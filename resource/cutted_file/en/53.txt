AB Sergej Ivanovitch Tjulpanov - the outstanding scientist, citizen,   diplomat, warrior, born at the beginning of the twentieth century, a man   of amazing destiny that was shaped and defined by the time and country   he lived in. The paper is a result of collaboration between   N.P.Kuznetsova - one the last S.I. Tyulpanov's post-graduate student and   Ingeborg and Michael Pardon - German authors of the "Sergej Tjulpanov -   the political portrait" project (and future book) based on enormous   volume of archive materials collected in Russia and Germany. German   colleagues particularly dwell on the Tyulpanov's activities in the   post-war Germany in the Department of Information (SMAD). After the   World War II he happened to be one of the founders of the Russian-German   friendship and cooperation, who has become a legend of Eastern and   Western Germany. The essential part of the paper is dedicated to   Tjulpanov as the Teacher and distinguished scientist-ideologist, the   founder of the Modern Capitalism Economy Department. Studying social   science including economics, history, philosophy, etc. he was committed   to what was called "Marxist-Leninist theory of social development",   trying to get reed of frozen ideological norms and in this format to   offload from dogmatism educating students, who took his example in the   invisible moral status "overflow" into the professional activityand vice   versa.

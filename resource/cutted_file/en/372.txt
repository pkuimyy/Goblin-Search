TI On replacing Labor as the substance of value: Early and recent arguments
SO SCIENCE & SOCIETY
AB Although Marx's labor theory of value is widely considered to be central   to his critique of political economy, both hostile and sympathetic   critics have continuously challenged the theory. The well-known   critiques of Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk and John Roemer have been disputed by   several authors working in the tradition of Marxist philosophy. A   different type of counter-argument, however, sticks as closely as   possible to Bohm-Bawerk's and Roemer's own method. This immanent   critique shows that they fail to refute the labor-value postulate even   in their own terms. This immanent critique should be seen as   supplementing, rather than replacing, existing counter-arguments.

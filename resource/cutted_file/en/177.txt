TI Althusser and Italy: A Two-Fold Challenge to Gramsci and Della Volpe
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB During the 1960s, the "exchange" between Louis Althusser and Italian   Marxist philosophers developed around the theme of the autonomy of   Marxism. Harmony between the theories of Althusser and Galvano Della   Volpe (and his students) was short-lived, and there was a definitive   break around the relationship between science and ideology. The chief   intermediary for introducing Althusser's thought to Italy was Cesare   Luporini, a philosopher and an active member of the Italian Communist   Party who brought For Marx and Reading Capital to Italy. Althusser's   grappling with Gramsci was constant, and after the critiques of   historicist Marxism, the author of Prison Notebooks came to hold   influence over the French philosopher with regard to political matters.   As Althusser's thought developed, considerable weight was also held by   the reading, mediated by Gramsci, of the works of Niccolo Machiavelli,   which consolidated his relationship with Italian political and   philosophical culture. Althusser managed to catch a glimpse of the   philosophical significance of the Gramscian conception of reality as   relations of forces (the philosophy of praxis) beyond the historicist   and humanist schema within which he had enclosed Gramsci in Reading   Capital. But his reading of Machiavelli would develop in the direction   of so-called aleatory materialism, also because to Althusser (for   deeply-held political reasons: his attachment to classism and to the   division of the world into two adversarial camps), the Gramscian   category of hegemony would always remain extraneous.

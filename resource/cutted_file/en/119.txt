TI Otto Bauer and the Philosophy of Praxis - Then and Now
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Otto Bauer (1881-1938) has emerged once more in the thought of Western   Marxists. The dominant theoretical voice of the Austrian Social   Democrats in the late Austrian-Hungarian Empire and the First Austrian   Republic, Bauer was re-examined in the 1970s and '80s as 'the third way'   was being explored in European politics by Eurocommunists. Bauer again   is being discussed in the twenty-first century as not only a European   'third way', but as a model for nations across the globe. Bauer's vision   theoretically as well as tactically between 1919 and 1934, when Austrian   fascism ended the political efforts of Austrian Social Democracy, was of   a pluralist parliamentary governance that sought through party   coalitions and the influence of social experiment a developing societal   praxis whose socialist principles would realise eventually Marx's   understanding of a classless society. A gradualism in long-range   strategy and tactics would lead democratically to greater collective   coexistence embracing differing cultures within and beyond separate   nations. Reviewed here are five publications between 2005 and 2011 which   are either thoughtfully supportive or critically dismissive of Bauer's   multi-cultural models for the socialist coexistence of communities and   nations. Two conference collections and three books on Bauer's thought   and political life enable the contemporary mind to evaluate the seminal   promise of Bauer's Marxist understanding, where for him Marxism was a   social-scientific instrument to guide societal development.

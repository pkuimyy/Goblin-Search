TI Marxism Lost and Found: Alasdair MacIntyre and the Contemporary Debate
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB This paper examines the changing nature of debates that focus on the   philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre. Whilst outlining the history of   MacIntyre's engagement with Marxism and some of his key ideas, it argues   that it is only recently that such debates have begun to rightfully   recognise the continued relevance of Marxism to such discussions. I note   that crucial aspects of MacIntyre's politics and philosophy,   particularly his opposition to capitalism, are now integral to the   contemporary debate which helps in generating a shared vision of radical   politics. Nevertheless, I point out that key disagreements still remain   as to the role of Marxism within such debates, the validity of   MacIntyre's critique of Marxism, as well as the potentially problematic   post-Marxist practice that MacIntyre advocates in After Virtue and   beyond.

TI Isabelle Garo and the Provincialism of French Marxism and Anti-Marxism
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Isabelle Garo's study, Foucault, Deleuze, Althusser & Marx: La politique   dans la philosophie, presents a historical approach to the French   philosophy of the 1960s and 1970s and its relationship to Marx and the   Marxist tradition. In her view, these authors were captured by a largely   mistaken understanding of the resources present in Marxist thought, and   were overly affected by the prejudices instilled by the French Communist   Party. Speaking from a perspective of practical commitment, she traces a   path from early French Marxism to an anti-totalitarian consensus. Her   study renders Louis Althusser's innovations the most pivotal in   introducing a whole series of themes, with ambivalent effects on   theoretical production today. Most significantly, she discerns a   replacement of politics and political economy by philosophy and   epistemology. She attends first to the mobilisation of psychoanalysis   against humanism, which gave way to a vehement critique of the normative   aspects of psychoanalysis itself. Re-reading Foucault and Deleuze as   post-Althusserians, Garo suggests that this led to a championing of   Friedrich Nietzsche's viewpoints against Marx. Garo's study is immensely   valuable in contextualising the apparent innovations of   poststructuralist thought. However, we can discern greater relevance for   the insights of these thinkers for contemporary Marxist thought than   Garo concedes, and her attempt to read them as a complete deviation from   Marxist principles ultimately fails to convince.

TI Revitalizing science and technology studies: A Marxian critique of
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE
AB This article revisits Marx's philosophy of history with respect to   technological change, outlining some elements for the elaboration of a   research agenda for materialist studies of science and technology. I   argue that dominant thinking on the subject has been insufficiently   attentive to relations of production and to the constitutive role of   practical, transformative activity. The article suggests that a focus on   class relations not only foregrounds the eminently open and contested   nature of technology but also renders into view the multiplicity of   actors and agencies involved in the making of natures. I draw from a   subterranean strand of Marxist theorists of technology to develop a   more-than-human approach to political agency through an interrogation of   the complex interactions between human and machine in the everyday,   experiential practicalities of the labor process. On this basis, the   article contends that foregrounding the class preconditions for an   alternative scientific praxis should assert itself as the starting point   and horizon of a materialist Science and Technology Studies.

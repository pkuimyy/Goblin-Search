TI PERESTROIKA IN SOVIET PHILOSOPHY TODAY
SO STUDIES IN SOVIET THOUGHT
AB The situation in Soviet philosophy has changed radically in the course   of the last 4 years. Gone is the attitude according to which   philosophers fall into two camps; genuine developments are discernible   in the direction of alternative thinking. Signs of the latter include   the growing number of round-table discussions published in the main   philosophical journals, the conversations among philosophers broadcast   on television, the new textbook, with its stress on the history of   philosophy, including a new look at the 'classics', especially Marx. In   general, Marxist-Leninist doctrine is now relativized to the status of a   moment in the history of philosophy, and is no longer regarded as the   culmination of philosophical truth.   The main questions occupying philosophers today cluster around the   nature of the person: individual freedom, democracy, universal values,   as well as the central importance of law in civil society and a legally   sanctioned State. The revival of interest in Russian religious   philosophy has to be approached with care as it involves several   dimensions: the question of Russia's spiritual character as compared   with the West, the confrontation with the heretofore reigning   materialist view of the world in relation to the vexed question of human   creativity, as well as the religious affirmation of the unity of   humanity in opposition to the Marxist conception of difference and   struggle. The situation in Soviet philosophy is still ambiguous so long   as ideological attitudes persist which could hinder the development of   autonomous philosophical thought.

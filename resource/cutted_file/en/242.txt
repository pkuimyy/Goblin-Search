TI Some Reflections about the Development of the Philosophy of Science and
SO PSYCHOLOGY, MANAGEMENT AND SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB Based on the history and present situation of Chinese and western   research on philosophy of science and technology, I have make two   thinking for the trend of this discipline development. One is treating   the western philosophy of science reasonably and establishing the   Marxist philosophy of science and technology research paradigm; the   second is that treating the modern philosophy as the guidance, and   increasing social dimensions of the philosophy of science and technology   research.

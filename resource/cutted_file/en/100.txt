AB This essay reconstructs a number of the historical-philosophical   sources, extraneous to the tradition of Marxist thought, that came   together to form the biography of the young Gramsci. It is here   hypothesized that the particular itinerary of Gramsci's Marxism, which   came to be defined as anti-determinist, may have been influenced by   certain philosophical currents (United States and European pragmatism,   French post-positivist epistemology) outside the tradition of the Second   and Third Internationals. In attempting to challenge a certain revision   of Marxism belonging to late nineteenth-century positivism, the young   Gramsci made use of theoretical equipment that belonged to epistemology,   together with pragmatist psychology, which taken as a whole allowed him   to retrace and relaunch the theoretical status of Marx's philosophy.

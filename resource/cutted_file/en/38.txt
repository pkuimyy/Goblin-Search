TI Left Radicalism and the Milky Way: Connecting the Scientific and
SO HISTORICAL STUDIES IN THE NATURAL SCIENCES
AB Anton Pannekoek (1873-60) was both an influential Marxist and an   innovative astronomer. This paper will analyze the various innovative   methods that he developed to represent the visual aspect of the Milky   Way and the statistical distribution of stars in the galaxy through a   framework of epistemic virtues. Doing so will not only emphasize the   unique aspects of his astronomical research, but also reveal its   connections to his left radical brand of Marxism. A crucial feature of   Pannekoek's astronomical method was the active role ascribed to   astronomers. They were expected to use their intuitive ability to   organize data according to the appearance of the Milky Way, even as they   had to avoid the influence of personal experience and theoretical   presuppositions about the shape of the system. With this method,   Pannekoek produced results that went against the Kapteyn Universe and   instead made him the first astronomer in the Netherlands to find   supporting evidence for Harlow Shapley's extended galaxy. After   exploring Pannekoek's Marxist philosophy, it is argued that both his   astronomical method and his interpretation of historical materialism can   be seen as strategies developed to make optical use of his particular   conception of the human mind.

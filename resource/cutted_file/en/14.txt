TI ALTHUSSER AND ROZITCHNER: TWO PATHS TO SPINOZA
SO ENDOXA-SERIES FILOSOFICAS
AB In the present work we will perform a counterpoint of the paths that led   the philosophies of Louis Althusser and Leon Rozitchner from the   problems opened up by Marxism toward the philosophy of Spinoza. We will   try to consider the moment in the life of each theory in which Spinoza   appeared, what theoretical problems led, in each case, to a conceptual   encounter with the thought of the Dutch philosopher and, in this sense,   what aspects of Spinoza's philosophy were taken up again. In Althusser's   case, the emphasis will be on Spinoza as an antidote against all   teleology and as the bearer of a materialistic conception of the   imagination; in the case of Rozitchner, Spinoza is present insofar as he   illuminates a deep rationality associated with the affective life of   men. In this way we will try to compare the constitution of two very   different paths, in order to account for the complexity and richness   that Spinoza's thinking acquires in the light of the problems opened up   by Marxist tradition.

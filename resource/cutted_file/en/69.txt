TI Does a Plurality of Philosophies Eliminate the Concept of the Subject
SO RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
AB The author considers the claim about the existence of a unified subject   matter of philosophy in the light of the existence of a diversity of   philosophies. It is shown that a unified subject matter of philosophical   inquiry for all historical periods is unfounded, and that Marxist   attempts to give a universal definition of the subject matter of   philosophy is inadequate. The author defends the position of a   qualitative change in the subject matter of philosophy in the course of   its development. The article provides an overview of major philosophical   themes through the prism of the subject-object relationship. The themes   under discussion include: nature (the universe, the cosmos, and   reality), the human agent, personality, individuality, subjectivity, and   the topic of a cognitive and active relationship between the human and   the world. The article shows that the unity of the subject matter of   philosophy can be defined only in the most general terms, since the   above main themes are only partially and idiosyncratically reflected in   different philosophies.

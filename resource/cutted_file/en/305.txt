TI A Brief Commentary on the Hegelian-Marxist Origins of Gramsci's
SO EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
AB The specific nuances of what Gramsci names 'the new dialectic' are   explored in this paper. The dialectic was Marx's specific 'mode of   thought' or 'method of logic' as it has been variously called, by which   he analyzed the world and man's relationship to that world. As well as   constituting a theory of knowledge (epistemology), what arises out of   the dialectic is also an ontology or portrait of humankind that is based   on the complete historicization of humanity; its 'absolute   "historicism"' or 'the absolute secularisation and earthliness of   thought', as Gramsci worded it (Gramsci, 1971, p. 465). Embracing a   fully secular and historical view of humanity, it provides a vantage   point that allows the multiple and complex effects of our own conceptual   heritage to be interrogated in relation to our developing 'nature' or   'being'.   The argument presented in this paper is that the legacy of both Hegel   and Marx is manifest in the depth of Gramsci's comprehension of what he   termed the 'educative-formative' problem of hegemony. It is precisely   the legacy of this Hegelian-Marxist radical philosophical critique that   is signified in his continuing commitment to the 'philosophy of praxis'   and the historical-dialectical principles that underpin this worldview.

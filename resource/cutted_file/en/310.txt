SO PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL CRITICISM
AB Two major developments of the last two decades have radically undermined   traditional justifications of leftist politics: the failure of   20th-century 'socialist' experiments, and what might be termed the   de-essentializing movement in contemporary philosophy. However, the   social injustices that animated revolutionary thinkers in many respects   remain, and some have arguably worsened in the era of globalized   capitalism. This article investigates whether it is possible to   articulate a new theoretical underpinning for progressive politics that   nevertheless avoids the essentialist moves of Marxism. Ethico-political   readings of Derrida - one of the most influential anti-essentialist   thinkers - are compared to Ernesto Laclau's attempts at formulating a   post-Marxist progressive politics built around the notions of 'hegemony'   and 'radical democracy'. Laclau's intervention in the Marxist tradition   is to deconstruct its traditional categories so as to take account of   contingency; his intervention in deconstruction is to introduce what in   this article is described as 'contestation', so as to provide a more   coherent account of the political. The article concludes that neither   deconstruction nor radical democracy provides an adequate basis for   poltical action, but that the latter's account of the political is a   meaningful development of the theoretical schema articulated by the   former and does point to the possibility of a non-essentialist   progressive politics.

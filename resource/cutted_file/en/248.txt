TI Chocolate and Chess (Unlocking Lakatos)
SO PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB Chocolate and Chess (Unlocking Lakatos) tells the fascinating story of   Imre Lakatos' life in Hungary before his flight to England following the   failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The book focuses on Lakatos' role as a   political functionary under Hungarian Stalinism, and compiles what is   known of Lakatos' role in the induced suicide of a young woman, Eva   Iszak, at the end of World War II. This historical and biographical   study provides essential background for appreciating Lakatos'   cross-cultural role as a philosopher in England and Hungary, through the   Anglo-American philosophy and the Hegelian-Marxist traditions in which   he was trained and did not leave behind.

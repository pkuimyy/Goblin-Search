SO LOGOS-VILNIUS
AB The article analyzes Marxist methodology of historiography of philosophy   in Lithuania This methodology represented the mechanicistic strategy of   interpretation, which treats the subject of inquiry as a regular product   of some non-theoretic reality The vertical reductionism regards   philosophy as the product of social relations and denies its   self-contained value. It approaches philosophy as ideology and   criticizes it as such It transforms philosophical problems into social   problems, formulates them in Marxist way, and finally reduces them to   ideology It ignores that some philosophical problems have nothing in   common with social questions.

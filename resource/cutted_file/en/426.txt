SO FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS
AB Svatopluk Stur (1901-1981) was one of the leading philosophers of   democratic orientation in Slovakia. He was a professor at the Bratislava   university and he was active mainly in the period between the world wars   and in 1945-1948. He is an offspring of a famous Slovak revivalist   family. He considered his philosophy to be a peculiar form of critical   realism and a part of the modern liberal philosophical movement. He   adopted creatively the humanistic thoughts of T. G. Masaryk, B. Croce,   J. L. Fischer and other European thinkers and he developed them in the   special situation of Slovakia. He was discriminated by both the   totalitarian regime of the years 1939-1944 and the communist regime   after 1948, when he was not allowed to teach at the university. One of   the important Stur's works is his Treatise on Life, written during the   Nazi occupation and published in 1946 in Bratislava. The chapters of the   book deal with a philosophy of life; with art - as its specific form and   part; with science - as the theoretical order of the world; with ethics   - as the practical order of the social life.  The present study, written   by Slovak philosopher J. Uher, throws light on the meaning of the Stur's   work mentioned in the context of contemporary philosophy and evaluates   it. Besides the Treatise on Life Svatopluk Stur wrote and published in   Slovakia the following works: The Problem of the Transcendent in   Contemporary Philosophy, 1938; The Meaning of the Slovak Revival, 1948;   The German Will to Power, 1944-1967 - as a Nazi paraphrase of   Nietzsche's Will to Power. His Marxist-Leninist Will to Power appeared   only posthumously (1991) and there are other still unpublished   manuscripts left in his heritage.

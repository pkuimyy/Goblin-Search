AB This is a review of the book: Sheehan H. Marxism and the Philosophy of   Science. A Critical History. The First Hundred Years. (L.: Verso, 2017.   XII. 450 p.). The keynote of the book serves the conviction that Marxism   is a sort of "super-theory" that can explain not only any social and   political life, but also profound philosophy of science, including   natural science. Science is presented in the book as a form of social   practice. The main idea of the Marxist philosophy of science is the   status of the theory of dialectical materialism. The author shows that   Marxist ideas could be considered as the origins of many disciplines:   the sociology of science, the history of science, the history of   technology; they had a noticeable effect on non-Marxist thought as well.   However, Stalinism and Lysenkoism significantly decelerated the   development of the Marxist philosophy of science.

TI Historicizing Gramsci: situating ideas in and beyond their context
SO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY
AB Across debates within political and international theory similar demands   have been made concerning the need to 'historicize' the theoretical and   practical legacy of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. Yet little   attention has been hitherto granted to the substantive ontological and   epistemological basis of such demands. By outlining a series of   interpretative controversies and examining in detail the question of   historicizing Gramsci, this article addresses some of the principal   demands to historicize Gramsci before discerning any contemporary   relevance. By tackling such demands within their own terms and according   to their own stipulations an immanent critique is developed. This tactic   of an immanent critique offers an approach to the history of ideas   useful to the present, it locates ideas both in and beyond their   context, and it also pushes one to consider what might be historically   limited in a theoretical and practical translation of past ideas in   relation to alternative conditions.

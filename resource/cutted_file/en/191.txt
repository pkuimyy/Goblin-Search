TI 'Theories are made only to die in the war of time': Guy Debord and the
SO CULTURE AND ORGANIZATION
AB The Situationist International (SI) has been one of the main reference   points during the past 40 or more years within social movement   organizing, cultural studies, social theory and philosophy. While the SI   has been understood in many ways as inheritors and elaborators of an   unorthodox Marxist politics drawing heavily from the history of the   avant-garde, relatively little attention has been paid to the   specifically strategic dimension of their thought and practice. This is   surprising, especially in Debord's case, given how much his work also   draws from the history of military strategy. This paper will   particularly examine the strategic aspects of Debord and the SI's   thought and politics and how they rethink the nature of strategy through   collective forms of aesthetic-political practice.

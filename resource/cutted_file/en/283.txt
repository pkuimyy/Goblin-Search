TI Karl Marx and Contemporary Philosophy
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB This essay is a review of Karl Marx and Contemporary Philosophy. While   the text will provide even knowledgeable Marxist readers with new   insights on key texts and concepts in Marx, it nevertheless fails to   intervene in crucial contemporary philosophical debates. The book is   concerned less with the contemporary significance of Marxist philosophy   as philosophy and more with re-reading classical Marxist texts in a   contemporary context. This job it does well, but leaves the more   important question of what Marxists have to say about fundamental   philosophical problems today unaddressed for the most part.

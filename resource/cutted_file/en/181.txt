TI ISSUES COGNITION IN MODERN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS
SO RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF CRIMINOLOGY
AB The article studies prospects of criminal procedural investigation   theory development in general and development of cognition in particular   in terms of possible deviations from previously dogmatic assumptions of   Marxist-Leninist philosophy.   Basing on informational concept of criminal procedural evidence, the   authors study objective laws of obtaining cognitive materials by   detectives, investigators, judges and developing corresponding images   that reflect facts to be substantiated. Authors consider current   achievements in philosophy, psychology, psychophysiology and   neuropsychology.   The achieved results let the authors justify two main methods of   criminal procedural cognition - verbal and non-verbal and define certain   trends in criminal procedural investigation theory development. The   trends may become methodological basis for studying nature and aspects   of certain types of investigation.

TI To Philosophize with a Burning Pulse: Sanchez Vazquez's Poetic
SO BAJO PALABRA-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
AB This paper analyzes the poetic foundation of Sanchez Vazquez's   philosophy of praxis, focusing on how his political commitment found its   first expression through poetry, before gradually becoming anchored in   theory and philosophy. We argue that his poetry is fundamental in his   evolution towards praxis and similar Marxist concepts.

TI Towards the place and relationship of philosophy and sociology in one
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The author analyses the development of the views of A. Siracky from the   second half of the 1960s on the role of philosophy and its relationship   to the newly established sociology. It was a period, when the most part   of the humanities felt themselves free and independent. During the   normalisation period this process was violently interrupted. The   author's point is, that A. Siracky as a representative of Slovak   intellectual elite also took part in this process, enforced from the   outside. In spite of certain criticism against Marxist dogmatism he   himself in his conception pursued consequently a dogma, according to   which both sociology and philosophy are ideological disciplines.

AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the analysis of the genesis of   the Soviet theory of law, in particular, of the sociological concept of   law by P. Stuchka. In this regard, the relation of jurisprudence with   other social sciences, such as philosophy, political science and   sociology, acquires particular importance. Special attention is paid to   the attempts of reconciliation of Marx's concept of withering away of   the state and the law in a communist society with the realities of the   young Soviet state. Purpose: to form a concept of prerequisites and   peculiarities of formation of Russian legal theory in the 1920-30s.   Methods: theoretical methods of formal and dialectic logic have been   applied. Results: the analysis shows that in their attempt to reconcile   Marxist theory with the reality and inner logic of the law the Soviet   jurists relied on the achievements of pre-revolutionary Russian legal   theory, primarily a sociological theory of law. In addition, the   relative epistemic pluralism of social sciences in the first decades of   the Soviet regime allowed them to elaborate original concepts, for   example, the concept of codification. Conclusions: the Soviet theory of   law in its early stages faced the problems of determining the essence   and the content of law, and of the relationship between the law, state   and society of a new type. The problems were caused by the dominant   ideology of Marxism-Leninism and epistemological obstacles in legal   knowledge. The attempts to solve these problems undertaken by the Soviet   jurists are of great interest to modern legal theorists who are in   search for appropriate methods of legal research.

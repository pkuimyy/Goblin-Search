TI CZECH AUTONOMISM: SHARED EXPERIENCES
SO 4TH ICPSIRS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON POLITICAL SCIENCE, INTERNATIONAL
AB Autonomous Marxism is not very well known in the Czech Republic. The   Czech autonomists have no web pages, have a certain inclination towards   secrecy, and on the rare occasion when they have participated in street   riots, were labelled as "anarchists" by the mass media. None of the   Czech autonomists know the Italian language, but they are well read in   the classical texts of autonomous Marxism through the translations of   Toni Negri's and Mario Tronti's books and articles. In some cases Czech   autonomists also published Czech translations of selected works directly   linked to autonomous Marxism. Our paper will present a short history of   Czech autonomism, mainly through the narration of the actors, using the   emic approach. (C) 2017 Published by Future Academy   www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

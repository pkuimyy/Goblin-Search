AB At the end of the XIX century in the Russian socio-economic community   dispute occurred on how to modernize the country dispute about "the fate   of capitalism" in Russia. One of the parties in this dispute were "legal   marxists". The article analyzes the social, ideological and theoretical   contexts of this dispute. It is shown that the marginal revolution   significantly change the situation in the economics of that time. From   the standpoint of the philosophy of science is given a rational   reconstruction of the changing attitudes of legal marxists to Marx's   economic theory. It is shown that they are quite rationally evaluated   Marx's theory as obsolete and regressing and seen in marginal program a   new and promising alternative in economic theory.

TI Feenberg and the North American philosophy of technology: the empirical
SO REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA AURORA
AB In my talk I intend to consider the feenbergian proposal of technology   transformation, in search of a path of equal distance (a) from the   heideggerian approach which takes technology as Gestell (framing),   nature as a standing reserve and the technological civilization as a   fate, imprisoning mankind in the huge system created by man himself, (b)   from the Analytic Philosophy approach which takes technology as an   application of science and thinks the Philosophy of Technology in the   extension from the Philosophy of Science, taking it as a know-how and   searching to circumscribe the practical syllogism (action rule) which   establishes the ties between knowledge, artifact and action, and (c)   from the traditional Marxist approach, which takes technology as a   productive force and thinks Philosophy in the extension of Economics,   thus, as something neutral, either as a machine or as a tool =   instrument. In his intellectual course, Feenberg seeks the elements to   rethink the nature of technology in the Critical Theory, finding them in   the praxis categories, such as totality, instrumental reasoning,   dialectics, etc., and introducing a tour de force to get rid from   Adorno's atavist pessimism and Marcuse's romantic optimism. Moreover,   maintaining the Frankfurtian inheritance, Feenberg will align to the   perspective of the empirical turn which characterizes an important   segment from the nowadays North American Philosophy of Technology, as   well as the so called Social Studies of Science (SSS), in which   Technology was added later, having the Social Constructivism and the   French School (Bruno Latour) as his main interlocutors. The focus of the   paper will be the empirical turn, marked by the search of empirical   support in the philosophical considerations about the Socio-Technical   systems (case studies, etc.) as well as the challenge of avoiding the   Philosophy of Technology to be carried by the Sociology/Anthropology of   techno-sciences.

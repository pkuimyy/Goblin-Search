SO CRITICAL DISCOURSE STUDIES
AB This paper situates the discourse of the Occupy movement within the   context of radical political philosophy. Our analysis takes place on two   levels. First, we conduct an empirical analysis of the 'official'   publications of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and Occupy London (OL).   Operationalising core concepts from the framing perspective within   social movement theory, we provide a descriptive-comparative analysis of   the 'collective action frames' of OWS and OL. Second, we consider the   extent to which radical political philosophy speaks to the discourse of   Occupy. Our empirical analysis reveals that both movements share   diagnostic frames, but there were notable differences in terms of   prognostic framing. The philosophical discussion suggests that there are   alignments between anarchist, post-anarchist and post-Marxist ideologies   at the level of both identity and strategy. Indeed, the absence of   totalising anti-capitalist or anti-statist positions in Occupy suggests   that - particularly with Occupy London alignments are perhaps not so   distant from typically social democratic demands.

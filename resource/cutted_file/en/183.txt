TI "On Practice" and "On Contradiction": The Inspiration behind the
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" result from the   combination of Marxist philosophy, the revolutionary practice of China   and the fine achievements of traditional Chinese philosophy, and have   enriched and developed Marxist epistemology and dialectics. "On   Practice" and "On Contradiction" are paradigms of the sinicization of   Marxist philosophy, providing valuable inspiration for its further   sinicization by elevating rich practical experience to the level of   philosophical theory; learning from and absorbing the latest   achievements of contemporary Marxist philosophy; inheriting and   developing the fine heritage of traditional Chinese philosophy; going   from specific philosophical issues to the sinicization of Marxist   philosophy; and making philosophy into a national cause.

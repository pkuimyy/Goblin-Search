SO PRESENTE Y PASADO-REVISTA DE HISTORIA
AB Developed during the 20th Century and registered in the Venezuelan   tradition of Marxist historiography, the work of Federico Brito Figueroa   (1921-2000) represents some aspects of the contributions as well as the   deficiencies present in a tradition that so far has only been partially   studied by the history of Venezuelan historiography. Thus, this article   intends to carry out a critical approach to the fundamentals and the   philosophy of history manifested in the work of the historian,   anthropologist and ethnologist from the state of Aragua. During the   research, we revised and analyzed the main historical works produced by   Brito from 1941 to 2000. We made use of German Carrera Damas' famous   scheme from the 1960's to guide the research on the most known   Venezuelan historians. This paper pretends to show how Brito Figueroa's   conception of history oscillated among his profession as a historian and   his fervent affiliation and support for Marxism.

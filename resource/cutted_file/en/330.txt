TI The Place and Significance of Blazenka Despot in Contemporary Croatian
SO FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB Blazenka Despot should he regarded as an extraordinary person among all   Praxis's contemporaries, because she was concerned with the same themes,   although she did not belong to the group, neither formally nor   conceptually She, like the philosophers closely) associated with Praxis   (where she used to publish occasionally, harshly and without pity   criticizes the so called socialist reality", but goes on even further to   examine and rethink the conceptual foundations on which it is based, as   well as its quality, range and truthfulness of the whole project.   Therefore, Hegel and Marx lie in the very centre, of her interest - the   differences and similarities between them, and their limitations and   insufficiencies regarding the historical context of our times. Putting   effort into the philosophical analysis of social phenomena (in an   anthropological-sociological discourse), she puts "socialist reality" -   and the ideas of its Marxist role-models side by side. Thus, she   "re-reads Hegel", and thereby also unavoidably, Marx in the context   completely neglected by both "socialist reality" and the entire history   as - in the context of humanistic emancipation of women. Opening that   theoretic-philosophical field of investigation, Blazenka Despot follows   the world trends in theory, including also dealing with the philosophy   of feminism, where, she left an indelible mark concerning her efforts to   deepen the "philosophy of freedom" and to establish feminist philosophy   in Croatia.

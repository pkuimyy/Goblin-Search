TI Intransigent archaeology. An interview with Evzen Neustupny on his life
SO ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIALOGUES
AB An interview with Evzen Neustupny opens up a range of issues regarding   the theory and history of archaeology and its development in Central   Europe. His view of the discipline differs in many ways from that of   current global trends. His 'artefact archaeology' inverts the concept of   adaptation and highlights the role of artefacts in the creation of the   human world. The interview also shows that post-war archaeology even to   the east of the Iron Curtain followed the trajectory from   culture-history paradigm to processualism and onwards. It also testifies   to the situation in the social sciences under the Communist regime and   the ambiguous role of Marxist philosophy.

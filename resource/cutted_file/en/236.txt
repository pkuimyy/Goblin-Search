TI Depoliticization or Americanization of Japanese Science Studies
SO SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY
AB In this paper, I will describe the history of Japanese science studies   (In the Japanese language, the term "science studies" [Kagaku-ron] is   used to indicate a broad area, which covers the history, philosophy, and   social studies of science and technology.) from the beginning of the   twentieth century to around the mid-1980s, and will argue how   depoliticization took place in its history. Japanese science studies was   formed under the conspicuous influence of German philosophy before World   War II (hereafter WW II), especially in its neo-Kantian tradition.   During the military regime, science studies offered a hiding place for   Marxists. However, after the end of the Asian-Pacific War, British   influence became stronger in the history and sociology of science in two   stages. First, logical positivism arrived, in this case, mainly from the   USA under the name of "analytic philosophy." Second, the American   influence was furthered by the introduction of Kuhn's theory of paradigm   which unexpectedly depoliticized Japanese science studies. This trend   seems to have reflected the course of the Cold War. After the Fukushima   Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, one of the most significant legacies of Cold   War Science, we need to review the history of science studies in order   to retrieve its "critical" function. Even though this paper focuses on   Japan, comparable reflections should be made worldwide.

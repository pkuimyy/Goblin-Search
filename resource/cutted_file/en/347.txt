SO HARVARD EDUCATIONAL REVIEW
AB In this article, John Holst presents findings of his historical research   on Paulo Freire's educational work in Chile from 1964 to 1969. Freire's   Education as the Practice of Freedom, which was written in 1965 from   notes he brought from Brazil, was informed by a liberal developmentalist   outlook. In contrast, his Pedagogy of the Oppressed, written toward the   end of his stay in Chile from 1967 to 1968, was influenced by Marxist   humanist ideology. Considering this relatively rapid change in Freire's   educational philosophy, Hoist explores the manner in which Freire's time   and work in Chile affected his ideological evolution. Hoist contributes   to Freirean studies by demonstrating that Freire's work in the Chilean   political context proved to be decisive in his ideological and   pedagogical growth. Freire's ideological evolution inspired his writing   of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, widely considered one of the most   important books on education in the twentieth century. Ultimately, Hoist   argues that Freire's pedagogy, like all pedagogy, can only be understood   fully when seen within the specific sociopolitical and economic contexts   within which it developed. Pedagogies are collective in nature, and   Freire's, as he himself recognized, was no exception.

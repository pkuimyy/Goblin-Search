TI Negativity and Event: A Dialogue between Adorno and Heidegger from the
SO BAJO PALABRA-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
AB This paper attempts to sketch a more radical interpretation of   Heideggerian ontology that went unnoticed by Adorno's destructive   criticism. In doing so we try to restore the emancipatory aspirations to   the dissolution of all domination that encouraged the author of Negative   Dialectik. Those efforts went unrealized in Adorno's thought because his   critique became lost in the horizon of metaphysics. To show this we have   chosen as an interpretive conduit Gianni Vattimo's reading developed in   his last nihilistic hermeneutics. This reading joins the most recent   attempts to develop a "left-wing Heideggerianism," but its achievement   is reengaging in a dialogue with Nietzsche and the Hegelian-Marxist   tradition, in order to reveal the transforming and differentiating   potential that still now courses through Heidegger's philosophy.

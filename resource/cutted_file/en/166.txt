TI The Role of Money in Plato's Republic, Book I A Materialistic Approach
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Seaford's recent work has revived and further substantiated a line of   argument that had been developed by Marxist scholars claiming a central   role for money in the genesis of philosophical thought. In a nutshell,   this line of argument holds that beneath the abstractions in which   philosophy breathes and with which philosophy works we can trace the   real abstraction of the money form as embodiment of abstract social   labour. Following this perspective, I will try to demonstrate the role   money plays in Plato's Republic, focusing on Book I.

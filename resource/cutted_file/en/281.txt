TI The body as sarx
SO FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS
AB The article attempts to revive the conception of the body in Ludwig   Feuerbach and the young Marx. The aim is to show that Feuerbach produced   a concept of embodiment which is to be distinguished from its conception   in psychoanalysis and in political thought (the body as the object of   bio-power) which prevail in contemporary post-Marxist theory. The   difference between these two conceptions can be expressed thus: the   Feuerbachian and young-Marxian understanding corresponds to the concept   sarx (the natural body), while its conception in post-Marxist thought   corresponds to the concept soma (the body symbolised).   Post-Marxist authors generally assume the correctness of Althusser's   rejection of this conception. It is for this reason that I examine   Althusser's critique of Feuerbach's philosophy in its relation to the   question of embodiment and I attempt to show that Althusser's theory   cannot comprehend Feuerbach's most important discovery.   In the final part I deal with Feuerbach as the first thinker of   non-identity (Adorno's term) and I look at his reflections on death as   the hidden background of his "living and real body". The conclusion is   that Feuerbach introduces a conception of embodiment which cannot be   completely incorporated into cultural and bio-political practices.

SO JOURNAL OF DOCUMENTATION
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer a theoretical framework   for applying Web 2.0 technologies and design principles to the   development of participatory cultures within libraries. A participatory   culture is one that focusses on facilitating interaction and the   creation of content by users rather than the consumption of content   created or compiled by experts.   Design/methodology/approach - This study is a literature-based   theoretical analysis that explores the role of libraries as agents of   cultural hegemony and techniques for developing socially responsible   library praxis. It combines insights from a variety of discourses   including Western Marxist theories of hegemony, critical theories of   library and information science, professional literature regarding   "Library 2.0" service models, and media studies theories of   participatory culture.   Findings - Libraries do not just organize knowledge; they construct it.   Furthermore, these constructions tend to reinforce dominant discourses   while marginalizing others. By adopting participatory technologies and   design principles, libraries can support greater diversity of expression   and create spaces for marginalized discourses.   Practical implications - This paper offers suggestions for applying   principles of participatory culture to the design of library services   such as collection development, cataloging and classification,   reference, instruction, and institutional repositories.   Originality/value - This paper provides a conceptual framework for   understanding and evaluating the significance of Web 2.0 for library and   information science by applying theoretical perspectives from other   disciplines.

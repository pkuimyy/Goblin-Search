TI AN ENCYCLOPEDIC METAMORPHOSIS OF MARXISM-LENINISM - SANDKUHLER
SO ARGUMENT
AB The >>European encyclopedia of philosophy and sciences<< edited by the   former marxist-leninist philosopher Hans Jorg Sandkuhler is examined   from two angles: on the one hand as a >>humanist<< Noah's Ark and   metamorphosis of M-L, thus as an expression of an intellectual   determinant of the situation following the collapse of Communism; on the   other hand as an object of comparison for a historical-critical   dictionary of marxism which a group involved with this journal is   working on for about eight years.

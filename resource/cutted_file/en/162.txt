TI THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON ANTONIO GRAMSCI AND THE RESEARCH OF
SO ETD EDUCACAO TEMATICA DIGITAL
AB This paper aims to present the investigation of the political milestones   in the work of Gramsci, to discuss certain challenges that "educational   research" must face. It is assumed that research in education is also a   way of teaching / hegemonic relationship can not be neutral in relation   to culture, but primarily as a producer of culture and vision of more   elaborate world. Studying issues of epistemology Gramsci requires   clarification of what the author understood by organic intellectual and   investigative praxis. The thought of Antonio Gramsci takes up the   Marxist principle of totality to understand the intellectual activity.   Given his conception of praxis category of intellectual gained another   meaning. His definition of organic intellectual has become crucial to   investigate the research of educational policies and not only   educational policies themselves. In this sense, the educational policy   is taken as a particular science, it deserves the same criticism that   Gramsci does sociology and economics, ie, produces partial truths that   must be re-appropriated as part of the entire research operated by the   philosophy of praxis.

TI Mapping the Constellation of Educational Marxism(s)
SO EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
AB In this paper, the author maps three radically different visions of   Marxism in educational philosophy. Each register contains insights but   also contradictions that cannot easily be resolved through internal   modifications of the theory or through theoretical synthesis with other   registers. The radical function of Marxist pedagogy is to create a   constellation of Marxisms through which the outline of history can   emerge. As such, the author ends with a new emphasis in Marxist   education on the exacting imagination of the teacher which creates a   constellational image of concepts and theories all of which hang in a   precarious and historically specific configuration.

TI An Introduction to Brzozowski-The First "Western Marxist" in Poland
SO UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE
AB The treatise mainly deals with the Polish philosopher Brzozowski's   thought. It sketches his life and writings and discusses his relations   to Orthodox Marxism. The recent research reveals him as inclined to   Western Marxism. However, unlike other thinkers of Western Marxism such   as Lukacs and Gramsci his intellectual position was controversial and   not unquestionably accepted by the Western world. The reason may be   found in his overwhelming devotion to the study of Polish arts,   literature and nationhood. Polish nationalism was more close to his   heart than Marxism. Thus, he was stripped of the name of a Marxist by   official Marxism which condemned and treated him as a deviator and   betrayer due to his idea blended with classical German Idealism. The   above-mentioned controversy may be clarified through revisit of his   theory of history and practice. This article aims at illuminations and   evaluations by Brzozowski's contribution to Marxism.

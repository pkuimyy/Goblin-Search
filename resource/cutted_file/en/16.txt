TI Equaliberty: Political Essays
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB In this review, I discuss Balibaes'proposition of equaliberty' with   regard to its theoretical status and contribution, its relationship to   other contemporary theories of radical democracy as well as to the   problematic of bourgeois versus communist emancipation in Marx. The   primary interest of this essay is to develop a detailed understanding of   Balibar's analytical schema, which draws a complex picture of our   contemporary 'human condition', and to place it within his own   theoretical development since his contribution to Reading Capital in the   6os. On that basis, it will he possible to assess his contribution to   thinking politics with and after Marx and place it more concretely   within the generalised radical-democratic turn in post-Marxist theory.

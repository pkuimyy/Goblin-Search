TI Beyond Belief: Islamist Strategic Thinking and International Relations
SO TERRORISM AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE
AB The development of radical Islamist strategic thinking and the impact of   post-modern, Western styles of thought upon the ideology that informs   that strategy is often overlooked in conventional discussions of   homegrown threats from jihadist militants. The propensity to discount   the ideology informing both al-Qaeda and nominally non-violent Islamist   movements with an analogous political philosophy like Hizb ut-Tahrir   neglects the influence that critical Western modes of thought exercise   upon their strategic thinking especially in the context of homegrown   radicalization. Drawing selectively on non-liberal tendencies in the   Western ideological canon has, in fact, endowed Khilaafaism (caliphism)   with both a distinctive theoretical style and strategic practice. In   particular, it derives intellectual sustenance from a post-Marxist   Frankfurt School of critical thinking that in combination with an   "English'' School of international relations idealism holds that   epistemological claims are socially determined, subjective, and serve   the interests of dominant power relations. This critical, normative, and   constructivist approach to international relations seeks not only to   explain the historical emergence of the global order, but also to   transcend it. This transformative agenda bears comparison with radical   Islamist critiques of Western ontology and is of interest to Islamism's   political and strategic thinking. In this regard, the relativist and   critical approaches that have come to dominate the academic social   sciences since the 1990s not only reflect a loss of faith in Western   values in a way that undermines the prospects for a liberal and   pluralist polity, but also, through a critical process facilitated by   much international relations orthodoxy, promotes the strategic and   ideological agenda of radical Islam. It is this curious strategic and   ideological evolution that this paper explores.

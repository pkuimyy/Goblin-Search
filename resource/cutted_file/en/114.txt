AB "Realistic Individual" is the starting point of Marx's philosophy. From   the descriptions of the nature of human in Marx's Thesis for the PhD and   "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844," to the initial concept   formation of " Realistic Individual" in " Holy Family," and the last   connotation on "Realistic Individual" in "German Ideology," we can   conclude that Marx's thinking, questioning, exploring in human nature   did not appear in a uniform appearance. According to Marx's above texts,   this paper will examine the formation and the development of "Realistic   Individual," in order to illuminate the unity of the stage and inherent   in the historic development of Marxist ideology, and to reveal that   Marx's ideology has been in the historical and logical unity.

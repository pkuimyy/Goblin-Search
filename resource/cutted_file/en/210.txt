TI Gramsci's 'Non-contemporaneity' Reflections on Peter Thomas's The
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Peter D. Thomas's book The Gramscian Moment: Philosophy, Hegemony and   Marxism draws us to reflect on a point that Gramsci's interpreters have   often neglected: the particular structure of the Prison Notebooks, i.e.,   the ways in which the text was constituted and, dependent on that, the   fundamental methodological criteria for its interpretation. Thomas's   book is a consummate synthesis between the deep and detailed study of   the Notebooks text and the need to reconstruct some order within;   between close historical-philosophical assessment and theoretical   proposal within contemporary Marxist (and para-Marxist) debate.   Consequently, this book confronts us as Gramsci's present-day readers   with a task that no-one can face alone, but that is nonetheless   extraordinarily urgent: the task of intervening in the debate within the   post-modem and post-Marxist Left so that the link between Marxism and   philosophy is resumed, starting out from Gramsci himself. In short: a   revival of Marx through Gramsci, through in turn a return of the   philosophy of praxis as Marxism for our own day.

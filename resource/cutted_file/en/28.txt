TI Frantz Fanon's Contribution to Hegelian Marxism
SO CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY
AB Although Frantz Fanon's work has been widely read and discussed in   recent years, his contributions are often abstracted from its debt to   Marxist theory and Hegelian philosophy. This paper seeks to correct this   by re-examining his approach to issues of recognition, identity, and   self-consciousness in Black Skin, White Masks in light of contemporary   issues of racism and ethnic identity. Fanon departs from Hegel in many   respects, especially concerning his understanding of the nature of the   'master/slave' relations that are structured along racial lines. He also   seeks to go beyond Marx by providing a psycho-affective as against a   primarily economic analysis of exploitation and alienation. Instead of   representing a departure of the dialectical tradition, however, Fanon's   insights on these and other issues represent a crucial extension and   concretization of it in light of the realities of his lived experience.

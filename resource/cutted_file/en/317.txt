TI Karl Popper and Hans Albert - The Broad Scope of Critical Rationalism
SO RETHINKING POPPER
AB It was in the English speaking world that Karl Popper first caught the   attention of broader philosophical circles, and it is primarily in this   same world that his views still continuously elicit a response, whether   positive or negative. However, in Central Europe the slightly delayed   Popper's influence has been quite often if not mediated then at least   supported by other developments within German philosophy. Not   surprisingly, from the very beginning Popper's philosophical return ran   up against the prevalent local philosophical tendencies of the times,   from a selective but mostly negative Marxist attitude to a patent   disinterest and disregard by most existentialists, phenomenologists, and   Heideggerians. A rather important role in this complex situation has   been played by Hans Albert; from the late 1950s on he has been an   outspoken protagonist for Popper's philosophy. The scope of Albert's   activities extends from expository endeavors to critical exchanges with   the opponents; of the latter the best known being his early involvement   in the so-called "Positivismusstreit", covering a substantial part of   the 1970s. However, Albert's role was never one of a mere apologist, his   own scholarly background allowed him to expand the sphere of problems   dealt with as well as the range of thinkers involved in such critical   discussions. To discuss those less known aspects of critical rationalism   will be the task of this chapter.

TI The irrational act: traces of Kierkegaard in Lukacs's revolutionary
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB The Hungarian theorist Georg Lukacs is known for his reintroduction of   Hegelian thought to Marxist philosophy-but I argue that his account of   the subjectivity of the proletariat owes just as much to the Danish   philosopher and theologian Soren Kierkegaard. Despite strong differences   in their outlook, their accounts of subjectivity have strong structural   similarities. For both, a division of the self against itself produces   suffering that leads in turn to a growing consciousness of the roots of   the problem; in the end, the self is restored through a relation to   itself grounded in the absolute, and thereby becomes capable of freedom.   Lukacs's theory of subjectivity is, thus, predicated on changing the   orientation of the proletariat towards itself-in ways that are deeply   indebted to the peculiar theology of Kierkegaard.

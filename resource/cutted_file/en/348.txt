SO JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
AB W. E. B. Du Bois provides an important, though often overlooked,   Africana history, culture, and philosophy-informed framework for (a)   redeveloping Africana studies and relating it to the crises and   conundrums of the 21st century; (b) reconstructing critical social   theory, making it more multicultural, transethnic, transgender, and   non-Western European-philosophy focused; and (c) reinventing what it   means to be an insurgent intellectual-activist (one who relates critical   theory to radical political praxis). Du Bois has been hailed as an   historian, sociologist, Marxist, and political activist but never an   early interdisciplinary social theorist with concrete political   commitments to not simply Black liberation and racial justice but to   women's liberation, the poor masses and working classes, and colonized   people of color worldwide. He has long been praised and criticized by   scholars who have interpreted and reinterpreted his work, often   overlooking its deep critical theoretical dimensions. In this article,   Du Bois's multifarious and ever-evolving social theory is situated at   the center and examined for its significance to the discourse and   development of Africana studies, contemporary radical political theory,   and revolutionary social movements.

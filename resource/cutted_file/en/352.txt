TI Self-appropriation and liberation: Philosophizing in the light of
SO Social Justice: Its Theory and Practice
AB Considering the play written by Daniel Berrigan about his own civil   disobedience (burning hundreds of draft files in Catonsville, Maryland),   the author asks whether Catholics have adopted the American dream at the   expense of Christianity How should we live and philosophize in an age of   American empire? Philosophy must be both practical and transformative.   We need to question our political situation since 200 1, and arrive at a   liberatory philosophy and social theory "from below" so as to meet   Berrigan's liberatory, prophetic theology "from above," resulting in a   philosophy and theology of liberation of and from the seductive   imperialist center. The author further stresses individual   self-appropriation and the critique of imperialism through a Marxist   understanding of surplus value (as arising from labor time for which   workers are not paid). There is a link between capitalistic imperialism   and militarism, and President Bush has made illegitimate use of religion   in the attempt to legitimate empire. Liberation is the good and the   happiness that together result from doing the work of justice, free from   capitalist corruption. In challenging capitalist empire, we ought to aim   for the "downward mobility" of a simpler lifestyle, where   self-appropriation leads to moral, religious, and practical conversion.   An inhumane, capitalist society is fundamentally at odds with us as   human beings, as philosophers, and as Christians.

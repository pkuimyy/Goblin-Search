TI How to Construct Marxian Thoughts as a Political Philosophy?
SO FRONTIERS OF PHILOSOPHY IN CHINA
AB Importance of contemporary political philosophy has increased in recent   decades. Since the 1970s, studies of Marx's theories have become an   important part of the discussion within contemporary theories of   justice. More extensive studies concerning Marxist political philosophy   from multiple perspectives are becoming a focal point in other fields of   academic research. "How to understand Marx's political philosophy?" has   been a classic question for over a hundred years. Not an academic   philosopher himself, Marx seems not to have issued a complete or   consistent political philosophy by today's standards, so it is only   natural that his views would be interpreted differently by different   scholars. While it is justifiable for us to construct Marx's political   philosophy, we must do it through a comprehensive theoretical   reflection, and our construction must take full account of the history   of the interpretations of Marx's political philosophy. This applies   especially of his theory of justice-a history which has lasted for more   than a century. It is even more important for us to reread the original   texts, particularly Marx's early philosophical writings, and take them   as the textual foundation for Marx's political philosophy.

SO ISEGORIA
AB Manuel Sacristan Luzon (1925-1985) was a logician, epistemologist and   unorthodox philosopher -PSUC-PCE militant during many years-who had an   essential role in the reintroduction of the Marxist-communist tradition   in our country at the end of the fifties. He proposed, during the last   years of his life, a strong revision of the communist ideology after May   68 and the annihilation of the Prague Spring. He also concentrated on   the irruption of environmentalism. His proposals for a politics of   science oriented in a socialist way, and close to the technoscientific   tradition which is not blind but which is critical of the new romantic   conceptions inspired in the work of Heidegger-about whose gnoseology he   wrote his doctoral thesis-are still proof of the lucidity and   penetration of his thought. He always fought for an (emancipatory)   passion that is anchored in reason and in scientific information, in the   commitment towards the most disadvantaged groups in the Earth, and in   the practice of a creative and humanist philosophy.

TI Arnold Hauser and the multilayer theory of knowledge
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB The sociology of art as synthesized by Arnold Hauser is based on a   theory of knowledge and articulates the cognitive role of art. In a   brief analysis, this paper elaborates on the sources of this   epistemological enterprise. The pedigree of Hauser's main thoughts was   oriented towards a Kantian and Marxist framework, respectively. As a   Kantian, he tried to take into account the philosophical consequences of   two (or even more) different sources of cognition that are equal in   value, correlative and necessarily cooperating. Giving exclusive   priority to only one of these leads to classical philosophical errors   such as psychologism and intellectualism. As a Marxist, Hauser was   anti-dogmatic and anti-deterministic, because he adopted an   interpretive-hermeneutical meaning of Marxism and considered it an aid   against distorting tendencies in our thinking. His basic insight that   the different sources of value-equal and cooperating cognitive layers   are in an everyday-life perspective intertwined, so that a kind of   reservatio mentalis is needed to methodically separate them for the sake   of better understanding, makes him a distant relative of classical   phenomenology. This web of epistemological investigations is what I call   the multilayer theory of knowledge.

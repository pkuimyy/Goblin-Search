TI The Clash on the Theological Left Or Marxist and Christian Again in
SO FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The author intends to reflect in this paper on text Marxist and   Christian, which originated in the dialogue led in 1969 between Branko   Bosnjak and Mijo Skvorc at the Student forum, which was a part of public   lectures series entitled "On Religion". The impulse for the meeting was   provided by the publication of Branko Bosnjak's Philosophy and   Christianity. After the launch of the book, there was a very well   attended forum followed by the publication of yet another book, Marxist   and Christian. This brief text, consisting of no more than one hundred   pages, has an indubitable importance for contemporary Croatian   philosophical thought. The text is composed in such a way that it seems   that both philosophers. respecting each other to the maximum, stepped   out of their comfort zone and created a new space for and a new kind of   dialogue at the time. That novel space has not been fulfilled yet, after   nearly forty, years. Marxism (Praxis Philosophy) and Christianity,   (Neo-Scholasticism) should continue the dialogue started back then even   in the contemporary context of different post-modern 'isms'. The last   part of the paper attempts to show why the dialogue between Bosnjak and   Skvorc, a Marxist and a Christian, is important still today, regardless   of the fact that both Bosnjak and Skvorc's discourse are in a kind of   cultural defensive.

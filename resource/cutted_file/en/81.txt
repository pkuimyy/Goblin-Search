TI Chinese modernization and the sinification of Marxism through the lens
SO ASIAN PHILOSOPHY
AB Li Zehou belongs to the most well-known and influential contemporary   Chinese philosophers of our time. Since he is one of the exiled   intellectuals, his work has also acquired a wide readership outside   China. Working mostly in the fields of classical Chinese philosophy and   Chinese aesthetics, he dedicated himself to the task of finding a   suitable and sensible way of harmonizing past and present, tradition and   modernity, China and the West. Hence, he attempted to create a synthesis   between early Marxist and classical Confucian discourses. The present   article offers a critical analysis of these attempts, focusing upon some   significant methodological problems underlying such approaches. The   author aims to explain them in the framework of the methodology of   intercultural research. Because in China, the problem of connecting   Confucian and Marxist thought is presently a much discussed and very   topical issue, the article also represents a contribution to the   clarification of this relevant question.

TI Can the oriental know justice? Can the subaltern tell stories?
SO NEOHELICON
AB In response to the contemporary American philosopher Michael J. Sandel's   tremendous popularity and ongoing engagements with Chinese philosophy,   which are often offered as evidence of a deep resonance between his work   and contemporary Chinese interests in justice, I argue that his   conception of justice as a product of the storyteller's narrative quest   encounters two potential problems when considered from a Chinese   perspective. The first is whether "Chinese" justice-which can be viewed   substantially as a collective if not individual attempt to overcome   subalternity as the Oriental subject-can be achieved through the foreign   forms of moral reasoning that are perhaps guilty of consigning Chinese   to their status as Orientals in the first place. The second questions   whether the Western culture of storytelling, of the heroic subject who   conquers the other (so often the Oriental in modern times), is not   already a product and producer of injustice, and in its contemporary   forms, a fantasy and fetish of capitalist society that is not only   incapable of individual justice, but also complicit in injustices   towards others. These points are raised in tandem with discussions of   ongoing generational shifts in China largely attributable to the rapid   expansion of a market economy and the growing normalization of   Western-style heroic, justice seeking storyteller, which might in turn   legitimize Sandel's approach to justice. However, from a Marxist   perspective, I argue that such developments might be Trojan horses for   new forms of subjugation, alienation, and inauthentic being-in short,   contra Western Orientalist universalism, the very injustices that   China's modernity project has aimed to overcome and with which it risks   assimilation.

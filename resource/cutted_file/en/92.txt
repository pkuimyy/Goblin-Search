SO PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL CRITICISM
AB Herbert Marcuse's early essays and reviews written while under the   tutelage of Martin Heidegger continue to suffer a poor reception. Even   the most sympathetic of his critics widely focus on either his   deviations from existing Marxist orthodoxy, or his failure to   demonstrate the commensurability of Marxism and existentialism. Although   both these concerns highlight important problems in Marcuse's work, this   narrow focus of Marcuse scholarship neglects essential aspects of his   early thought, particularly his concern with what types of truth claims   inform political action, and how one might assess the validity of these   claims. This article examines these overlooked facets of Marcuse's early   thought, with particular emphasis on the role of judgement.

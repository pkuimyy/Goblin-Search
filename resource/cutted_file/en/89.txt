TI The Many Encounters of Deleuze and Marxism
SO DELEUZE STUDIES
AB Deleuze's and Guattari's work on schizoanalysis represented an important   shift towards a dialogue with Marx and his critique of political economy   but in the 1970s prominent Marxists attacked Deleuze (and Guattari) as   anti-Marxist. This attitude marked one of the most important missed   encounters between Marxism and other theoretical currents. However,   there have been important recent contributions that bring forward not   only the political character of Deleuze's theoretical endeavour, his   critique of capitalist social forms, his conception of social practice   and struggle, but also the linkages with the Marxian and Marxist   concepts. The aim of this article is to highlight some aspects of the   many dialogues between Deleuze and Marxism.

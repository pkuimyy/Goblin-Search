TI Beyond cynicism: The sceptical imperative and (future) contemporary
SO CONTEMPORARY THEATRE REVIEW
AB 'Beyond Cynicism' sets out to question the radical, or political,   potential of the postmodernist philosophies which have underscored a   significant strand of experimental performance over the last four   decades. Rather than critiquing the postmodern from a Marxist or   materialist perspective, the article returns to the self-deconstructive   movement of Derrida to assess whether the capacity for political action   and radical change is inherent within postmodernism itself.   The article argues that the sceptical imperative, which is 'fundamental'   to Derridean thought, contains the key to a constant self-reflexivity   which prevents any 'totality' of conclusion being established. The   logical consequence of this is that the 'conclusions' of the early   postmodernists cannot be merely accepted by contemporary performance   makers but must be rigorously and continually challenged in order to   maintain the potential for political action and radical change.   On the basis of this argument the article is able to make key   distinctions between sceptical and cynical postmodern performance. It   proposes that where Forced Entertainment's Showtime (1996) consistently   questions its own scepticism by foregrounding the ghosts of the mimesis   it simultaneously deconstructs, work which may have comparable 'motifs',   such as Reckless Sleeper's Spanish Train (2006), presents only the   foregone conclusions of the postmodern exercise, thus rejecting   self-reflexivity to establish a new 'totality' which mirrors the   'incommensurable narrative play' defined by Lyotard.   The article concludes by examining the process and politics of 'making'   self-reflexive performance, through an analysis of the author's own   production of Roses Morphine (2005). This analysis highlights the   importance of sustaining paradox in the making process, whereby the   contradictions, which lie at the heart of the maker's own rhetorical   operations, are exposed to ensure that conclusions are deconstructed   even as they are reached.

AU Gifford, James
TI Place, Personalism, Anarchism, & Fantasy: Recasting Late Modernism
SO LITERATURE COMPASS
AB This essay outlines an ongoing critical intervention in the growing   field of late modernist studies by recuperating anarchism as a political   philosophy for English language writers of the 1930s and 1940s. The   first section gives an overview of the development of late modernism as   a critical category and how its early basis in Marxist criticism   developed from the Auden generation. The second section traces new and   expanded international networks made visible through attention to   anarchist rather than Marxist sensibilities. The third section considers   the development of fantasy genre fiction based on the emergence of major   authors from the antiauthoritarian literary networks outlined and as a   continuation of the political transformation of activism to literary   aesthetics and form. The conclusion anticipates coming expansions in the   critical corpus through attentiveness to anarchism more broadly in late   modernist studies and the new modernist studies generally.

TI Epistemological contributions to the study of science in the latter days
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB During the last quarter of the twentieth century, Soviet Russian   philosophy did away with ideology in the fields of Science; but until   the mid-1980s, scientists could not escape intense ideological scrutiny.   A great number of Soviet scientists did their best to avoid this   ideological supervision, and pursued their research, remaining neutral   toward Marxist ideology. Among these fields of research were so called   "philosophical problems of natural sciences" (The Western counterpart   would have been the Philosophy of Science). Some Soviet Russian   philosophers put forward original conceptions of scientific development,   the structural features of science, and/or provided novel   interpretations of certain scientific principles and ideas. These   thinkers had deep roots in Marxism, though not orthodox Marxism. They,   so to speak, overcame classical Marxism and proposed innovative ideas   largely based upon epistemological considerations. The legacies of I. S.   Alekseev and M. A. Rozov are especially worthy of attention for their   original epistemological contributions to the philosophy of science.

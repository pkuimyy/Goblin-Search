AB This study compares the epistemic beliefs of Chinese preservice teachers   from Taiwan, Singapore, and China. These three localities signify three   different socio-political variations of Chinese culture. Employing an   adapted survey instrument created by Chan and Elliott (2004), 630   preservice teachers from the three localities were surveyed for their   epistemic beliefs, including beliefs about the nature of knowledge and   learning. The results indicated that, with respect to beliefs about   knowledge, relativist epistemological beliefs are generally held by the   preservice teachers from Taiwan and Singapore, whereas the sample   teachers from China were categorized as being in the multiplist   epistemological stage. With respect to beliefs about learning, Taiwan's   preservice teachers expressed much more tendency to believe that ability   is innate or fixed than did the samples from Singapore and China. The   results of the current study further implied that, on the one hand,   different educational philosophies (i.e., Democratic Western philosophy   versus Marxist materialism) may have an influence on beliefs about   knowledge; on the other hand, the varied paths of educational   development and educational philosophy may result in different beliefs   about learning. The implications for future study of personal   epistemology are discussed.

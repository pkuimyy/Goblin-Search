TI As Orteguians as Marxists: a re-reading of the debate between Manuel
SO ANALES DEL SEMINARIO DE HISTORIA DE LA FILOSOFIA
AB In order to understand the debate between two thinkers considered to be   Marxist, the current article propounds to situate them within a   philosophical tradition represented by Jose Ortega y Gasset. This   tradition met in an original way international and philosophical   debates, and only drawing from that tradition it is possible to   understand Manuel Sacristan's proposal to put an end to the faculties of   philosophy in 1968; to this suggestion Gustavo Bueno responded. The   reconstruction of this debate allows to salvage a reflection on the   philosophy of Ortega which enables original responses to the problem of   the autonomy of philosophy and its relationship to other forms of   knowledge. This reflection was critically updated restructured during   the debate between both authors, though until now has gone relatively   unnoticed.

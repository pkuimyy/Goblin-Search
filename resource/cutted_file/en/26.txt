TI THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REASON IN THE AGE OF TECHNOLOGY: COGNITION X
SO REVISTA ON LINE DE POLITICA E GESTAO EDUCACIONAL
AB The teachers education in the current universe of technologies and the   need to obtain students capable of thinking and thinking for themselves   has been a constant challenge and difficult to overcome for many   teachers at all levels of education. The competition of the school with   the media, if on one hand helps the students life; On the other hand, it   puts them away from the possibility of deeper researches, from contact   with a physical library, since the superficiality of the themes offered   by the Internet often assumes this role, making difficult to develop   logical reasoning and their own capacity to write with clarity, cohesion   and creativity. But how can we produce quality texts if the student is   not trained to exercise the dialectic and does not have content to do   them so? The researches which have been developed by us over the last   twenty years, based on the concern with the quality of teaching, are   based in particular on the teacher's ability to lead the student to   reflection, creating a cognitive network that is not directly linked to   dogmatic teaching, which is capable to reduce their vision. The   educational reform recently proposed by the government proposes a school   without indoctrination, however, many teachers feel incapable of finding   a way to help their students to be more critical and observant, since   many History, Geography or even Philosophy manuals present a clearly   Marxist tendency. How to lead the student to reflection, without being   led by doctrinal paths? How to get him to reflect on the problems in   which he lives in, in order to distinguish a rational thought from a   biased one, if the world around him, the media, especially the internet,   provides him with clearly doctrinal bases? In this article we will try   to present ways that either was useful for the formation of Pedagogy   teachers or in the work with high school students, aiming the   development of their capacity for reflection. Based on Psychology   (BETTELHEIM, 1980; JUNG, 2008) in the Philosophy of Education (LIPMAN,   1994), in the anthropology (ELIADE, 1972; CAMPBELL, 2013) and in the   Classical Philosophy (PENHA, 1994), we will present our approach to   training critical and questioning students.

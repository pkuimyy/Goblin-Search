TI Ernst Bloch in the DDR Hope - Utopia - Marxism
SO DEUTSCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHILOSOPHIE
AB When the Marxist Philosopher Ernst Bloch arrived in Eastern Germany in   1949, he was already 64 years old and not very well-known. Nonetheless   he became one of the most important thinkers of the early GDR. A few   years after his arrival, in the mid-50s, conflict between him and the   communist leaders and their SED party escalated due to opposing views on   the conceptof freedom. There were further disagreements on the role of   the subject in history and the (un-)importance of utopianism. Following   the escalation he was politically and academically isolated, which led   to his leaving the country in 1961. But his philosophy of hope was kept   alive in the GDR, especially in oppositional circles. Thus one can find   elements of his utopianism in works of dissidents such as Rudolf Bahro,   Wolfgang Harich and Robert Havemann.

TI Yearning for Philosophy (Aleksandr Ogurtsov: in memoriam). Article I
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB The article analyzes the tragic period of Soviet philosophy development,   that has begun with expatriation of the most famous Russian philosophers   in 1922 and lasted until 1989, when the article named "The Suppression   of Philosophy" by A.P. Ogurtsov was first published. The inner springs   of physical and ideological terror against the philosophers, who tried   to make their contribution to philosophy, are revealed here. The   produced analysis furnishes insights into the logic of what happened.   Also it provides the feeling of close continuance of the guiding idea   leading from the Hegelian dialectic to the colossus of Marxist-Leninist   philosophy. All this breaks off while stumbled upon lifeless coldness of   emptiness, because "the logic of terror means that there is no other   space for the logic itself". And then the investigation of the Soviet   philosophy turns into some kind of "nightmarish dream inside a dream".

TI Ontology of Production: Three Essays
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB This is a review-essay on William Haver's recent translation of three   essays by Nishida Kitaro in a volume entitled Ontologies of Production.   Nishida is one of the founders of the famous Kyoto School of philosophy   and, while his philosophy is not really Marxist, Haver attempts to bring   Nishida into dialogue with Marx in his Introduction and through his   selection of essays to translate. I attempt to situate Haver's   translation in a brief discussion of a recent debate on how to write   modem Japanese intellectual history and, through this examination, I   suggest a framework for analysing modem intellectual history drawing on   the work of Harry Harootunian, Moishe Postone and Jacques Bidet. In   short, this framework attempts to relate the production of ideas to the   temporal dynamic associated with capital, the commodity-form and other   related mediations that make up the modem global capitalist system. Then   I turn to Haver's Introduction and translations and both explain some of   the key concepts of Nishida and show how, using the framework that I   outlined, Nishida's work can be conceived of as failing to understand   its own conditions of possibility in the multiple mediations of   capitalism. For this reason, Nishida's work, like many other romantic   critiques of capitalism, criticises the abstractions of modernity at an   abstract level, failing to account for the mediations of capitalism such   as class and the commodity.

TI Consumerist Culture in Zygmunt Bauman's Critical Sociology: A
SO POLISH SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB In this article I analyze Zygmunt Bauman's oeuvre on consumerist   culture, from the Polish (1953-1968) and English (1968-2017) stages of   his scholarly career. I demonstrate that despite the passage of many   years and the numerous changes in the way Bauman approached sociology,   it is possible to see considerable overlap between the interpretations   that he advanced in the two periods of his career. In the first part of   the article I focus on how Bauman's observations-dating back to the   sixties and relating to the theory of culture, Marxist theory, and the   method of ideal types-found their reflection in what he called the   "consumerist syndrome" (seen as a set of properties permeating all   planes of social life). In the second part of the article I highlight   the fact that his observations were inspired by a model of critical   sociology that evolved from Antonio Gramsci's "philosophy of praxis" and   utopian thinking of an iconoclastic nature. And even though my analysis   focuses on the denotative and conative dimensions of Bauman's vision of   consumerist culture, I also present more general conclusions regarding   the continuity and variability of his entire sixty-plus years of   scholarly activity. The article offers an opportunity for   English-speaking readers to become familiar with Bauman's Polish   writings and should encourage further research in this area.

TI The Reception of Emmanuel Mounier in Croatia and the former Yugoslavia
SO NOVA PRISUTNOST
AB The work reviews and analyzes the reception of the French Catholic   philosopher and thinker, originator of personalistic movement, Emmanuel   Mounier (1905-1950) in Croatia and the former Yugoslavia until 1965. It   investigates the articles on Mounier, his own works as well as his   influence on personalistic endeavours in the region. First brief echoes   of his thought on Catholic and pronounced thinkers in Croatia can be   found as early as in 1930-ies, however, without any relevant positive or   negative criticism. Namely, Mounier's tendency towards Marxism and   socialism was not acceptable for them. Croatian emigrants adhered to   such reserved sentiments towards Mounier. After the Second World War the   only acceptable standpoint was Marxist and personalism, being considered   as a 'bourgeois philosophy", was denied. The only exception was Mounier,   to whom the post-war Marxists have an ambivalent attitude and after the   break of Tito and Stalin in 1948, even a positive one. This is a   philosophical-historical rarity, taking into account that Mounier was an   apparent Catholic thinker. Hence reception of Mounier can be considered   as a vanguard of the so-called convergence of Christianity and Marxism   in 1960-ies but also as a political pragmatism of then Yugoslav official   ideology.

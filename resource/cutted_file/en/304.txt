AB Psychoanalysis and Marxism: the splitting of the Argentine   Psychoanalytic Association (1971) The article looks at an unusual event   in which the history of psychoanalysis and that of the Marxist left   intersected: the resignation of two groups from the Argentine   association on ideological grounds. Looking to go beyond the testimony   of the protagonists and interrogate the accounts focusing on the event,   the text explores the conditions and alternatives of this encounter   between Freud and Marx from the 1960s onwards, particularly in academia   (the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters of the UBA), in a professional   organization (the Argentine Federation of Psychiatrists) and in   political organizations active during the period (the Communist Party   and revolutionary Peronism).

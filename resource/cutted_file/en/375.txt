TI Questions about the history of Slovak philosophy
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The history of Slovak philosophy can be reconstructed along two basic   lines: along the line of the school (academic) philosophy, developed at   existing high schools, colleges and universities, as well as along the   other line - that of philosophical (social) thinking. The researches   should focus not only on professional philosophy, but also on the forms   of applied (and also implicit) philosophical thinking as a part of the   community's culture. The standpoint of the researches should be   non-ideological, non-national, non-ethnical. "The Slovak philosophy" is   related to all philosophical expressions, historically present in Slovak   region or in Slovak culture. This option as an alternative to previous   paradigmatic scheme, used by Marxist historiography. It represents a   methodological issue par excellence, demanding a special attention and   also theoretical and methodological selfreflection of the historians of   philosophy.

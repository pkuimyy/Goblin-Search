TI A MARXIST WHO SPEAKS ABOUT GOD: REFLECTIONS ON MAX ADLER'S RELIGIOSITY
SO JOURNAL OF JEWISH THOUGHT & PHILOSOPHY
AB This paper examines Max Adler's philosophical thought, in order to   elucidate how he was able to spot a religious meaning in the   materialistic conception of history and to understand his connection to   Judaism. The first part expounds on how the prominence of religious   issues was perceived in the Marxist milieu; the second part analyzes   Adler's particular position, above all in harmony with Kantian   philosophy; and the third part brings out the essential differences   between Adler's and Kant's ideas on religion. Finally the paper shows   how Adler's hope in an ultramundane salvation of mankind separates his   interpretation from Jewish messianism.

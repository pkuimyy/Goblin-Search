TI ON THE RECEPTION OF PLATO'S POLITICAL IDEAS IN POLISH PHILOSOPHY OF THE
SO PROBLEMOS
AB The main purpose of this paper is to prove that the attitude towards   Plato's political ideas among Polish scholars depended on political   situation of Poland and Europe. Selected works of three periods are   under examination. Before the World War I the enthusiasm towards Plato's   political ideas prevailed. In the interwar period the enthusiasm waned   and the utopian project of the Republic was considered as impossible to   be carried out. After the World War II Plato's project was negatively   evaluated by the opponents of the totalitarianism and communism as well   as by the Marxist philosophers. The former considered communism to be a   fulfillment of Plato's ideas, the latter thought of Plato as an enemy of   the democratic system.

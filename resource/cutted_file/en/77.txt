TI Sensation and politics in Gilles Deleuze
SO REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA AURORA
AB This article questions the fine and precise relationship between art and   politics into the thought of the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze   (1925-1995). It tries to show how Deleuze, partly following the   unfinished work and youthful Nietzsche, wants to make a political   philosophy give yourself a logic of sensation. And not like the Hegelian   or Marxian or Marxist, etc. who have always thought politics from a   negative logic of the historical dialectic. The plan Deleuze, mainly in   its last stage, in his work on art in general and, in particular, with   painting versa from a logic of sensation. And it is from this logic that   expresses the place where politics is given.

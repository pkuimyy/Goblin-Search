SO BULLETIN OF HISPANIC STUDIES
AB The present article reviews, from a critical, theoretical standpoint,   the 'semiotic of Culture' that leading colonialist Walter Mignolo   undertook to construct in his early works. These works combined   classical structuralism, which promotes an objective approach to   literature, with its inverted, equally positivist counterpart,   hermeneutics, which foregrounds the role of the subject. Both projects   collapse at the point where they run up against the existence of an   all-encompassing 'ideology'. Their underlying ahistorical, neo-Kantian   idealism secretly nurtures a 'resistance to theory', based on a flawed   philosophy of science. We play off this neo-Kantian idealism at all   points against the critical realism of Althusserian Marxism, which   theorizes the notion of an 'ideological unconscious'. On the latter's   terms, as expounded by the Marxist scholar, Juan Carlos Rodriguez, not   all ideological discourses operate, historically, through the category   of the subject. The epic, essay and autobiography serve to illustrate   the contrasting critical approaches under review.

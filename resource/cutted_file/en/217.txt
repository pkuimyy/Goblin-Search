TI "DEAR MASTER", "EXCEPTIONAL STUDENT": THE RELATIONSHIP OF A. GRAMSCI
SO GIORNALE CRITICO DELLA FILOSOFIA ITALIANA
AB In this article we try to reconstruct the relationship between the life   and work of Antonio Gramsci and Annibale Pastore, teacher of Theoretical   Philosophy at the Turin University. The great marxist intellectual   followed Pastore's lessons in 1914-15. It was there he faced for the   first time the Marxian thought and many other sides of philosofical   culture between two centuries. In discussing this matter, Pastore   provided us with some evidences in the postwar period and some critic   essays about the Prison Notebooks' publishing. An intricate connection   comes out, made of many themes they both developed, themes that worth to   work on.

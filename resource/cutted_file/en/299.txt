TI ANALYTICAL PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE AND SCIENCE IN LITHUANIA
SO PROBLEMOS
AB The paper presents an overview of analytical philosophy in Lithuania. It   is observed that analytical philosophy had not been studied or developed   in Lithuania before the 1970s, when Evaldas Nekrasas and Rolandas   Pavilionis began their work in philosophy of science and philosophy of   language, rooted in analytical tradition. The article discusses the   works of Nekrasas and Pavilionis, as well as those of others (e.g.,   Degutis and Plesnys). It notes that analytical philosophy was the first   non-Marxist trend of philosophy to be developed in post-war Lithuania,   and thus it was of considerable influence at the time when the Marxist   methodology had to be overthrown. Although the influence of analytical   philosophy in Lithuania has diminished during later years in favour of   postmodern trends, it is still evident in some recent works on   philosophy of mind, philosophy of causation, and methodology of the   humanities and social sciences. It has also made a strong impact upon   the development of political philosophy and research in the history of   positivism.

TI The contemporary development of philosophy of education in mainland
SO COMPARATIVE EDUCATION
AB This article introduces and analyses recent developments in philosophy   of education in mainland China and Taiwan. Though Confucianism has very   rich insights into education, philosophy of education as a discipline   came to China only around 100 years ago. It reached its first climax in   the 1920s and 1930s, but then went into decline for nearly half a   century. In the meantime, western trained philosophers of education were   gaining influence in Taiwan from 1949. After the epoch of the Cultural   Revolution and implementation of the open door policy, a revival of   philosophy of education occurred in the 1980s, combining the long   ruptured Confucian tradition and western philosophy of education with a   reconceptualization of Marxist educational ideas. Though western   traditions remain dominant, especially in Taiwan, Confucianism, Taoism,   Buddhism and neo-Confucianism have all been taken as frameworks in   developing educational theories. It is argued, in conclusion, that what   is needed is to make a real marriage between traditional Confucianism   and western philosophy of education.

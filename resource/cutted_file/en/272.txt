TI Lysenko Affair and Polish Botany
SO JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY
AB This article describes the slight impact of Lysenkoism upon Polish   botany. I begin with an account of the development of plant genetics in   Poland, as well as the attitude of scientists and the Polish   intelligentsia toward Marxist philosophy prior to the World War II. Next   I provide a short history of the introduction and demise of Lysenkoism   in Polish science, with a focus on events in botany, in context with key   events in Polish science from 1939 to 1958. The article outlines the   little effects of Lysenkoism upon botanists and their research, as well   as how botanists for the most part rejected what was often termed the   "new biology." My paper shows that though Lysenko's theories received   political support, and were actively promoted by a small circle of   scientists and Communist party activists, they were never accepted by   most botanists. Once the political climate in Poland altered after the   events of 1956, Lysenko's theories were immediately abandoned.

TI The Concept of tawhid as the Basis of Ideology of Islamic Rule in Iran
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB The article deals with philosophical and political views of Murtaza   Mutahhari (1902-1989), one of the most remarkable thinkers of modern   Iran. Mutahhari was known as the disciple and the closest associate of   Ayatollah Khomeini the leader of the Iranian Revolution of 1978-1979.   Mutahhari was working on his ideology, which could be: first, a   realistic alternative to Shah Reza Pahlavi's ideological doctrine and   the theories of Islamic Marxists, and secondly, the acceptable source of   legitimacy of Islamic Rule. Islamic theories of political structure have   traditionally evolved as a result of philosophical reflection on the   fundamental problems, such as: the understanding of God and the   relationship between God and world, God and man, the basis of just   governance of Islamic society and Islamic state and so on. The close   relationship between religion, philosophy and politics was reflected   most clearly in Mutahhari' discourse: he recognizes the need to   establish the form of Islamic government in Iran and creates for its   justification a special ideology, using the statements of Islamic   doctrine and Islamic values.

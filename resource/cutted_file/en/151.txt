TI The 'Two Marxisms' Revisited: Humanism, Structuralism and Realism in
SO JOURNAL OF CRITICAL REALISM
AB The ontological and analytical status of Marxian social theory has been   a matter of fierce controversy since Marx's death, both within and   without Marxist circles. A particular source of contention has been over   whether Marxism should be construed as an objective science of the   capitalist mode of production or as an ethico-philosophical critique of   bourgeois society. This is paralleled by the dispute over whether   Marxism ought to be considered a humanism (or critical theory of human   agency) or a structuralism (or science of social systems). This article   addresses both sides of this debate. The argument is that, rather than   Marx's own social thought being split into incompatible poles, giving   rise to 'two Marxisms', it forms a coherent unity. Marx's social theory   is neither humanist philosophy, nor structural science, but is in fact   realist science, which synthesizes these apparent antinomies, and   thereby transcends both.

AB The article is devoted to intellectual evolution of the Hungarian   philosopher and ideologue Georg Lukacs (1885-1971) whose theoretical and   political development reveals the character of the 20th century in a   special way. In the first part of the article, the author, starting from   the fact that Lukacs was awarded the Goethe Prize in Frankfurt am Main   (1970), analyzes the antithetical origins of his philosophical position.   The views of the thinker were formed under the influence of the   sociologic vision of history and the concept of the generic forces of   Marx. However, inspired by German culture Lukacs turned to the Goethe's   ideal of the creative personality, in order to overcome the   methodological one-sidedness of the Marxist image of a man oriented   towards the socialized concept of labor.   In the second part of the article, the author focuses on the hidden   source of Lukacs' position: Nietzsche's metaphysics of power. He puts   forward the thesis that the formation of Lukacs' revolution has been fed   from the earliest times by the concepts of the philosophy of life. The   subsequent involvement of the thinker in the ideological circle of the   revolution and civil war weakened Nietzsche's influence. However, it can   be traced in Lukacs' interpretation of culture as the creativity of the   proletariat's liberated forces. The author raises the question of the   extent of Lukacs' personal responsibility for violence, which the   thinker understands as "the path to the rise and freedom of culture",   going exclusively through dictatorship. The central theme of the fourth   part of the article is the ideological influence exerted by Lukacs   during the so-called "1968 revolution" in Germany, as well as a critical   moral assessment of this influence.

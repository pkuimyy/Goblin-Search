AB This review article situates the work Black Flame within a capita   selecta of earlier publications on anarchism-syndicalism and radical   thought. Schmidt and Van der Walt's contribution (2009) is a recent   addition to political thought, theory and socio-economic practice within   the broad stream of anarcho-syndicalism. Its treatment of anarchism and   anarchist syndicalist groups in the workplace within an international   context since the middle 1800s and the attempt to situate the debate in   contemporary society are some notable features. The authors engage with   the past relevance of anarcho-syndicalism and implications for the   future given current discontent with (global) politics. As an ongoing   discourse on social philosophy, references are made to areas of   agreement and differences between Anarchist and Marxist discourse. The   latter versus one 'grand narrative' conjectures that liberal-capitalism   on a global scale is bringing about an 'End of History' and that we have   entered a post-industrial or even post-modern condition on the globe.   However, theories-put-into-practice around the implosion of history and   a 'clash of civilisations' result in deep inequality and the rise of   absolute poverty. The work invites reflection and critical engagement.

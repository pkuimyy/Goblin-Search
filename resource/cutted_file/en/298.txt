TI MARXIST HISTORIOGRAPHY OF PHILOSOPHY IN LITHUANIA: HORIZONTAL
SO PROBLEMOS
AB The article analyzes the Marxist methodology of historiography of   philosophy in Lithuania. The so-called interpretative solipsism is   characteristic of the horizontal reductionism. It enforces the   conceptual apparatus of its own theoretical position upon the subject of   research, without considering whether the terms of that apparatus have   something in common with the content of the subject. There are different   degrees of interpretative solipsism in the Lithuanian history of   philosophy. Zaksas is a priori convinced that his own theory is   impeccable and that the subject of inquiry is undoubtedly fallacious and   theoretically worthless. Balcius and Griska pay more attention to the   description of the subject of inquiry. They rely on the materialistic,   atheistic and scientist aspects of Marxism. Lozuraitis and Mureika   regard Marxism as quite a reliable method of solving some theoretical   problems. Their approach is akin to the methodology of the history of   problems.

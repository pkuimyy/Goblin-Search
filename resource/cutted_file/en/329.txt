TI Philosophy of Praxis in the Rear-view Mirror of Mediology
SO FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The crucial questions of this text are the following: How much has the   praxis philosophy itself succumbed to the frames around its act of   reflection, thinking and contemplation? Opposing the strong hierarchy of   politics, has it used the well known methods of hierarchical   self-preservation? How much was its call for revolution just an echo of   times of(technological) revolutions? How much did the insisting on the   concept of revolution influenced the creation of unhappy consciousness   of their student's generations, ready for changes, and stopped on the   level of revolutionary interpretations of their professors' theories?   Finally how much is McLuhan right when criticising Marx not seeing the   changes that were happening right in the time he lived, not seeing that   the industrial hardware, created the environment (for the Marxists   invisible) of the global information? The text explores how the   technological frame determined the hierarchy, ideology of thinking and   the form of criticism of this ideology.

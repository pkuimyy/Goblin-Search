TI Spider and Fly: The Leninist Philosophy of Georg Lukacs
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB From 1919 to 1929, the great Hungarian Marxist philosopher Georg Lukacs   was one of the leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party, immersed not   simply in theorising but also in significant practical-political work.   Along with labour leader Jeno Landler, he led a faction opposing an   ultra-left sectarian orientation represented by Bela Kun (at that time   also associated with Comintern chairman Zinoviev, later aligning himself   with Stalin).   If seen in connection with this factional struggle, key works of Lukacs   in this period - History and Class Consciousness (1923), Lenin:A Study   in the Unity of His Thought (1924), Tailism and the Dialectic (1926) and   'The Blum Theses' (1929) - can be seen as forming a consistent,   coherent, sophisticated variant of Leninism. Influential readings of   these works interpret them as being ultra-leftist or proto-Stalinist   (or, in the case of 'The Blum Theses', an anticipation of the Popular   Front perspectives adopted by the Communist International in 1935). Such   readings distort the reality. Lukacs's orientation and outlook of 1923-9   are, rather, more consistent with the orientation advanced by Lenin and   Trotsky in the Third and Fourth Congresses of the Communist   International.   After his decisive political defeat, Lukacs concluded that it was   necessary to renounce his distinctive political orientation, and   completely abandon the terrain of practical revolutionary politics, if   he hoped to remain inside the Communist movement. This he did, adapting   to Stalinism and shifting his efforts to literary criticism and   philosophy. But the theorisations connected to his revolutionary   politics of the 1920s continue to have relevance for revolutionary   activists of the twenty-first century.

TI Doing underlaboured theory
SO JOURNAL OF CRITICAL REALISM
AB This essay connects the two critical realist ideas of underlabouring and   meta-theory, making the argument that the process of underlabouring and   making disclosure and transformation of the deep categorical structures   of science and theory' (Hostettler) is ideal for clarifying strata of   theory (meta-theory, domain-specific theory and methodology) and   therefore points of agreement between different practitioners. Using the   1980s debates over feminism in art history, I show how two important   interlocutors - T. J. Clark and Griselda Pollock - used Marxist   meta-theory to establish a baseline on which their domain-specific   concerns might diverge. A return to this sense of shared agreement and   disagreement is urged.

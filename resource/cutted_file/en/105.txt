TI CINEMA VIOLENCE AND THE ONTOLOGY OF CAPITALISM
SO CINEMA-JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY AND THE MOVING IMAGE
AB Cinema, in its most massively produced and widely disseminated format in   the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, is violent. In dialogue with   both the public discourse and scholarship regarding the cinematic   representation of violence, this paper approaches film violence through   a Marxist framework. It does so to propose that the philosophy of Karl   Marx reveals critical insight regarding the relationship between cinema,   violence, and capital. In particular, this essay scrutinizes commercial   narrative cinema and thus approaches cinema as hegemony. The violence of   cinema is considered to have a role in reproducing the social   organization of capitalism, namely the hierarchical relationship between   the ruling and ruled classes. Cinema has historically used violence in   narrative and spectacle to propagate these relations of production, the   ontology of capitalism that consists of Cartesian subjectivity and its   vertical orientation towards the Other. In other words, violent cinema   is crucial for the subject in capitalism, for it shares the pivotal   function of perpetuating class antagonism. But because cinema must   constantly mediate the violence of capital, simultaneously obfuscating   it while also maintaining it, violent cinema - like the proletariat -   also holds the emancipatory potential of its own critique and eventual   dismantling.

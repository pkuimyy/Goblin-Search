TI The senses as direct theoreticians in practice
SO TRANSACTIONS OF THE INSTITUTE OF BRITISH GEOGRAPHERS
AB The senses are relationally produced through, in part, the everyday   activities of making urban space. This reciprocal relationship suggests   new ways of exploring the conditions of possibility for an urban   politics. In seeking to chart such possibilities, we turn to the twofold   understanding of aesthetics found within Marx's critique of political   economy, using this as a lens through which to learn from the practices   of insurgent artists and anarchitects as they perform relational urban   interventions' in the cities of London and New York. Just as Marx railed   against the anaesthetising tendencies of capitalist society, and saw   within communism the possibilities for the liberation of the senses and   the freeing of creative activity, so relational urban interventions   develop a twofold aesthetic model. Nevertheless, recent scholarly   attempts to consider the political life of sensation and to theorise the   relationship between space and politics have been filtered through a   post-Althusserian lens that is less attentive to emergent possibilities   within critical spatial practice. Taking a different tack, we call for a   philosophy of praxis that builds on an understanding of relational   sensuousness and a Marxist aesthetics in order to prise open the   conditions of possibility for an urban politics.

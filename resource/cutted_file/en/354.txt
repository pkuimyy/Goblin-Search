TI Freedom, desire and revolution: Alasdair Macintyre's early Marxist
SO HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT
AB This article examines the pre-history of Alasdair MacIntyre's   contemporary moral philosophy. In the 1950s and 1960s MacIntyre was a   leading member of the British New Left, from whence he gravitated   towards a form of heterodox Trotskyism. During this period he began to   formulate a Marxist ethics which both compares with and informs the   thesis of his magnum opus After Virtue. As the conclusion of After   Virtue is premised upon a dismissal of Marxism, it is of some interest   to explore the exact route through which MacIntyre came to replace his   earlier with his later framework. The article, after reconstructing   MacIntyre's Marxist ethics, traces the trajectory through which he came   to reject Marxism, and shows that while MacIntyre's mature critique of   Marxism first took shape in the 1960s, his political pessimism was built   upon two assumptions - that Marx's economic theory was outdated and that   a defensible theory of human nature did not exist - which he has   recently questioned. The conclusion is that MacIntyre's rethinking of   these assumptions has opened a space for a renewed dialogue between   himself and Marxists.

TI Strawmen at the Symposium: A Response
SO PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB In this essay, we reply to the five commentaries offered of our 2016   book, Socrates Tenured: The Institutions of 21st Century Philosophy. We   argue that, in a recursive fashion, those commentaries exemplify the   thesis of our book - that contemporary philosophy has a blind spot   concerning the philosophical priors of its status as an institution.   That is, 20th and now 21st century philosophy has limited metaphilosophy   to being an exclusively theoretical exercise, neglecting to also pursue   a philosophy of philosophy' in its material, bureaucratic, and Marxist   dimensions. After making these points in the introduction, the article   is divided into three parts that deal, in turn, with comments that are   facile, earnest, and provocative. We then conclude by noting the   unintentional irony of our contemporary situation, where the vast   majority of philosophy departments are inhabited by sophists rather than   philosophers.

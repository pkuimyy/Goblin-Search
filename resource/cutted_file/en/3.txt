TI State, Emancipation and the Rise of China
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB Marxist tradition as a social philosophy has sought to locate   emancipation in the person of the working class or various other   sub-state actors. However, it has been obvious for long that the   metahistorical agency entrusted with those forces is less than viable.   Offering an alternative perspective to the question of the agent of   emancipatory action, the present research attempts to situate the   potential of emancipatory praxis in international relations with the   state acting as the primary actor for dialectical change. It holds that,   if a radical shift from the contemporary conditions of economic and   political subjugation to respect for sovereignty, inclusive development   and peaceful coexistence is to be realized, the direction of   emancipatory flow must be from international to national. Thus, through   a re-contextualization of emancipation at the interstate level of   analysis, this study proposes a thorough evaluation of China's   conceptualization of international governance against the backdrop of   its ongoing material and ideational emergence.

TI The Horizons of Scholasticism and Lo Kuang's Research on Zhu Xi
SO UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE
AB The horizons for the modern study on Zhu Xi are pluralistic; while the   Marxist and historical approaches are based on historical criticism,   Chien Mu and Yu Ying-shih's historical approach is meant to explicate   its historical rationality and solve contemporary cultural conflicts. Mo   Zong-san approaches Zhu Xi through Kant's philosophy and the philosophy   of mind to facilitate the further development of Confucianism, while Lo   Kuang's scholastic approach, meaning to introduce Catholic philosophy   into Chinese culture, is also an important dimension in the modern study   of Zhu Xi. Alternating between the systematic and the historic   methodologies, Lo Kuang strongly approved Zhu Xi's doctrine because his   philosophical system of benevolence, theory of mind-nature and theory of   moral cultivation. are supplementary to scholastic philosophy. Based on   scholasticism, Lo Kuang redressed the problems with Zhu's philosophy:   the conflicts caused by the dichotomy of li and qi, the insufficiency of   essence as the criterion of good and evil and the inability to solve the   problem with the cause of the individual being. Exploring deeply Lo's   study of Zhu Xi and the possible approaches to assimilate Chinese and   western philosophies, we could see how to understand Chinese   philosophical frameworks creatively and promote the autonomy of   contemporary Chinese philosophy.

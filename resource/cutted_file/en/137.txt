TI Adam Smith and the Educative Critique: A response to my commentators
SO STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION
AB This paper is both a response to the four reviewers in a special   symposium on my book Adam Smith's Pluralism and a substantive discussion   of philosophy of education. In it, I introduce what I call "the   educative critique," a mode of analysis similar to Marxist, feminist, or   postcolonial critiques, but focusing on the educative role of a text. I   argue that choosing education as a theme is itself a solution to   interpretive difficulties, not an add-on that only concerns pedagogues   and policy-makers.

TI Gramsci and society - From the critique of Marxist sociology to the
SO REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE SOCIOLOGIA
AB In the Prison Notebooks there is a critique of sociology that leads to   the elaboration of a "science of politics". In this essay, it is argued   how this critique -that starts off as political intervention in the   context of the Third International- is related to the main points of   Gramsci's reflection, as the relationship between theory and politics   (and the status of theory), and between philosophy and ideology, the   concepts of historical necessity, law and science. It is shown how the   result of the research is not, for Gramsci, mainly the rebuttal of the   idea of a social legality, but the redefinition of the law in terms of   "regularity", a notion in which political will and economic necessity   are synthesised.

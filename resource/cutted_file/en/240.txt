TI Marxism as a science of interpretation: beyond Louis Althusser
SO SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
AB Inspired by Louis Althusser's polemic that Marxism is a science and not   a philosophy, we enquire about the nature of this 'scientificity' of   Marxism. The result is a clarification that Marxism is a social theory   within the discourse of hermeneutics. Drawing on William Dilthey's   categorisation of human science as Geisteswissenschaft, which   essentially is an interpretive science when differentiated from   Naturwissenschaft, we point out that Marxism should be understood and   used as a socio-hermeneutic theory. We highlight that at the pinnacle of   his intellectual development that resulted in Das Kapital, Marx produced   a scientific principle for interpreting historical social formations and   the human condition, particularly during the capitalist epoch. The   description of the scientific character of this hermeneutic principle,   set against what Althusser attempted, and motivated by the quest for a   contemporaneous application of Marxist theory, is the mission of our   paper. It is a contribution to the Philosophy of Social Science.

AB Ecological tourism is widely popular because it has special impact on   promoting economic development and protecting ecological environment. It   is a sustainable tourism development pattern. In recent years, China has   made great progress on rapid development of ecological tourism. However,   some problems need to be solved badly during the development Blindly   pursuing rapid development led to heavy environmental pollution, so we   need to promote the study on Marxist Ecological Concept and use it to   improve our analysis and guidance on China's current ecological tourism   development situation, come up with some countermeasures to promote   China's ecological tourism, to achieve harmony between human and nature,   and to search a path of ecological tourism development with Chinese   characteristics.

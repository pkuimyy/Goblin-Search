SO MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
AB This discussion piece sets out to introduce Hegelian-Marxist dialectic,   revolving around the wider concept of pr axis, to the wider   meta-theoretical debate in International Relations. A perusal of the   peculiar historical trajectory of IR theory, culminating in the   ambiguities of the current 'post-positivist' debate, establishes the   case for the necessity of explicating the meta-theoretical foundations   upon which scientific statements are predicated, in ol der to allow for   meaningful inter-paradigm debate and critique to take place. An excursus   into the philosophy of science exemplifies the potency, if not   superiority of dialectical thinking over and against various forms of   traditional science, which were gradually forced to modify their   positions by drawing on dialectical insights. Against this background,   the article then observes the almost complete lack of dialectical theory   in the discipline of IR, before it constructively attempts to   systematise the core tenets of dialectical thinking. It is argued that   G.W.F. Hegel's difficult formal categorical apparatus was given the   adequate social content by Karl Marx allowing for a critical and   comprehensive grasp of social and international relations.

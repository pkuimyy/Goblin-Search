TI FROM SOCIAL SUBJECT TO THE PERSON - THE BELATED TRANSFORMATION IN
SO PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB With the dismantling of Marxist-Leninist ideology, fresh inspiration has   been discernible in recent Soviet philosophy. This article argues that a   major area of concern is the nature of the human being a theme formerly   dominated by the ''social'' conceptions inscribed into official   historical materialism. Soviet philosophers are examining such   categories as culture, spirit, consciousness, and personality with an   eye to their common characteristics. For many, the latter is grounded in   the nature of the person, the specificity of which lies in a morally   qualified unity of action, sentiment, and reason. The author brings   together evidence for this thesis and discusses the arguments of the   Soviet philosophers with an eye to their conceptual resources and   models.

TI The Series Philosophical Legacy (1973-1990): Its Character,
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The paper offers a description of the second project (after the   publication of 10 volumes of Philosophical Anthology 1965 - 1977) of the   translations of the books of influential philosophers into Slovak. The   project has been carried out in the time of strict political   normalization and neodogmatism. In spite of the political conditions the   editors managed to publish 20 volumes of classical philosophy, 10   volumes of the Western philosophy of that time and 16 volumes of Marxist   philosophy. The impact of the project was far-reaching. First of all, it   offered a support to Slovak philosophy, which at that time was on its   progressive way to the status of an academic discipline.

TI How to Interpret Labor-based Human Rights From the perspective of
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTEMPORARY
AB Labor falls under the category of social existence while human rights   fit into the category of social consciousness. Unlike the human rights   deriving directly from the thought of God-based natural rights,   labor-based human rights need a sequence of intermediary transitions on   the path of interpretation to be possible. According to value   philosophy, labor constructs the useful value relation and purposeful   value relation. In the social existence level, productivity is included   in the useful value system and production relations are part of the   purposeful value system. In the field of social consciousness, both   political and ideological superstructures belong to the value system   constructed by labor. Therefore, labor has constructed the relations of   law at the class level and national level. Labor is the source of   rights, which is the very concrete reflection of the labor value system   in the superstructure. As recognized by law, human rights are, in form,   the product built by all classes through labor; and in content, they as   an ideology reflect the value relation between man and nature as well as   between man and man. Therefore, it can be said that human rights come   from labor.

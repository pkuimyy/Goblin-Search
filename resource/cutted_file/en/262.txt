AB This article tries to perceive how secularization spreads in a legal   state and in the European Union. The author states that when a legal   state begins to violate the life issues, the state ceases to form a   democratically healthy society. Secularization is a process in which a   person tries to "escape" from religious influence in the society and to   leave religion in "a private corner". The author proves that the supreme   escape from the influence of God used to be in the philosophy of   Nietzsche, when God was "killed." This philosophy was espoused by   Hitler, and Europe was" liberated in the best way" from Christian   influence by deaths of millions. By immense historical indicators the   author proves how both atheistic ideologies of Nazism and   Marxist-Leninism cooperated until the very beginning of the Second World   War. In one word, secularization has no limits. Secularization can   become very dangerous in certain circumstances. The rejection of belief   in a society inclines towards a denial of God. The laws of European   Union concerning the family, birth and religion already abuse the right   of birth. The article tries to show the point of view of the Holy See in   the future of the European Union and the theologian's mission in a   globalized world.

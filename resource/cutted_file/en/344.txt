TI Symmetry, asymmetry, and the real possibility of radical change: reply
SO STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
AB In his critique of my book Heidegger and Marcuse, Jeff Kochan (2006)   asserts that I am committed to the possibility of private knowledge,   transcendent truths, and individualism. In this reply I argue that he   has misinterpreted my analysis of the Challenger disaster and Marcuse's   work. Because I do not dismiss Roger Boisjoly's doubts about the   Challenger launch, Kochan believes that I have abandoned a social   concept of knowledge for a reliance on the private knowledge of a single   individual. In fact, I consider Boisjoly's observations just as social,   if not as scientific, as the results of rigorous scientific study.   Kochan's reliance on a principle of symmetry derived from science   studies to explain such politically charged technological controversies   tends to mask the role of power and ideology in social life. Kochan   interprets Marcuse as a failed Heideggerian who regresses from   Heidegger's social conception of human being to traditional   individualism. I am accused of sharing this view. This interpretation   overlooks the importance of the Hegelian-Marxist category of 'real   possibility' in Marcuse's work and so mistakes his critique of   conformist politics for individualist romanticism. Marcuse always   attempted to ground radical opposition in a community of struggle   without abandoning the heritage of a long critical tradition. This view   I willingly share.

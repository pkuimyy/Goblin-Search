AB In this introductory essay to Radical Philosophy Today, Vol. 3, the   editor places the broad movement of Marxist philosophy into a tradition   that, since Plato, has endeavored to stimulate desire for concepts of   justice, in contexts of flourishing commercial power. Although Plato and   the modern philosopher both know the risks of such undertakings (it was   majority rule that put Socrates to death), and although powerful   commercial interests have never been altogether comfortable in   philosophical company, nevertheless the academy and the work of   philosophy proves to be a curious necessity, as this collection of   essays demonstrates.

TI A Phenomenological take on the Problem of Reification
SO MODERNA SPRAK
AB This article attempts to provide a new look at an old idea within   Marxist discourse. Reification, as first imagined by Marx and later   Lukacs, describes a process by which capitalism transforms human beings   and social relations into things. Although the concept has been   subjected to much abstraction and reinvention over the years, this   article attempts to address a foundational problem that has remained   unsolved since its inception: Close analysis reveals that the concept of   reification has never been developed to include an example of an   alternative or non-reified state of being. To solve this foundational   problem, I look beyond Marxism and to the phenomenology of Maurice   Merleau-Ponty. For Merleau-Ponty, the body is our primary vehicle for   being-in-the-world, but what makes his philosophy unique is his emphasis   on embodied subjectivity, as well as his dialectical conception of   corporeality and being-in-the-world. From this view, the social and   material worlds can best be understood as dynamic realms of   intersubjectivity, while sentient beings always exist as subjects prior   to the reifying effects of capitalism. Building upon an ongoing   dialectic between the ideas of Marx, Lukacs, Merleau-Ponty and others, I   will ultimately reframe the concept of reification as a objectifying   tendency, precipitating from capitalism's ability to obscure the lived   experience of the phenomenal body.

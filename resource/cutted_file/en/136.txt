TI The Metaphilosophy of Eugenio Trias
SO PENSAMIENTO
AB The article is an interpretation of the Metaphilosophy of Eugenio Trias   as the liberation of one's identity (as opposed to subjectivism), and   which is parallel to the liberation on the discourse of metaphysics   (opposite to the anti metaphysical attitudes of Orthodox -Marxist   theories- ideologies and logical positivism). The intimate relationship   of this topic in two of his works will be analyzed, and which are not   usually associated with the metaphilosophy of Trias, for instance,   Philosophy and Carnivals (with a proposal for the conception of   identity, such as the abundance of masks and of sociability, as   Carnival) and Dispersion (from his fragmentary, aphoristic thought).   Both works would respond to the same strategy termed by Trias as   "magical", and in this article (as is elucidated at the end) as   "cynical".

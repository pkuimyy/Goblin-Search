TI Anton Pannekoek's Epistemic Virtues in Astronomy and Socialism Personae
SO BMGN-THE LOW COUNTRIES HISTORICAL REVIEW
AB Anton Pannekoek (1873-1960) was both an innovative astronomer and an   influential Marxist. In this article we will investigate both his Milky   Way research and Marxist philosophy, with special focus on his ideal   scholarly persona and the epistemic virtues he advocated in his   research. This focus allows us to place Pannekoek in the larger   development of scientific methodology during the nineteenth and early   twentieth century and, most importantly, offers insight into how   Pannekoek's scientific and socialist research were related.

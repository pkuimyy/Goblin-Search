TI Assumptions Related to the Literary Persona in Demetillo's Barter in
SO KRITIKE-AN ONLINE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
AB Literature is the bearer of all the treasures in the world-that includes   the Filipino's ideology and philosophy, which are reflected in their own   literatures. This literary analysis is a descriptive-qualitative   research, employing the Marxist criticism in the assumptions related to   the literary persona in Ricaredo Demetillo's Barter in Panay.   Specifically, the literary analysis unveils the relationship between the   poet's milieu and his literary persona, the socio-political phenomena   revealed by the literary persona, and the critical views on race and   power relations based on the construction of the poet's literary   persona. The findings reveal that Demetillo, by projecting himself in   his literary persona, Datu Sumakwel as a capitalist, favors today's   capitalism and displays him to be a bourgeois proletarian. Through the   assumptions regarding the literary persona in Demetillo's literary epic,   we can hear the voices of the folks in the past who were the ruling   class, and the voices of the modern folks-both the ruling and the ruled   in today's world. The persona's poetic voice comes from the memory of   every Filipino who lives in the here and the now, who passes the   folkloric and historical records of ideologies to the younger   generations.

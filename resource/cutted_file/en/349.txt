AB This essay is a review of Peter McLaren's most recent work, Capitalists   and Conquerors: A Critical Pedagogy Against Empire. The essay situates   McLaren's work in the philosophical tradition of Marxist Humanism, with   reference specifically to Raya Dunayevskaya and Paulo Freire. Despite   invoking the work of Dunayevskaya as a foundation for his own project,   McLaren does not offer a robust explication of this important thinker,   nor of the Hegelian-Marxist discourse she embraced. Here, as in much of   McLaren's work, the reader is not offered rigorous analysis of his   philosophical assumptions. The dearth of such analysis, this essay   argues, compromises the critical thrust of McLaren's work. In turn, the   essay sketches a framework for unpacking the Marxist Humanist paradigm,   and, thereby, rethinking the philosophical foundations of contemporary   critical pedagogy.

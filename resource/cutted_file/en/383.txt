TI Main currents of post-Soviet philosophy in Russia
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTIETH WORLD CONGRESS OF PHILOSOPHY, VOL 12:
AB With the destruction of the Soviet Union and the fail of the Communist   Party, Russia in the past few years has experienced a philosophical   revolution unparalleled in suddenness and scope. Among the salient   features of this revolution are the displacement of Marxism from Its   former, virtually monopolistic status to a distinctly subordinate and   widely scorned position: the rediscovery of Russia's pre-Marxist and   anti-Marxist philosophers. in particular the religious thinkers of the   past two centuries: Increasing interest in Western philosophical   traditions that were neglected or condemned during the Soviet period;   and special attention to the philosophy of culture, with particular   reference to the role of philosophy in the national culture of Russia.   In all of these new directions, a recurring and controversial theme is   the widely perceived need for a new "Russian idea." or something to   "fill the ideological vacuum" left by the demise of Russian Marxism.

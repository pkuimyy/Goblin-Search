TI 3 KINDS OF ECONOMISTS - MEMBERSHIPS AND CHARACTERISTICS
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND SOCIOLOGY
AB The diversity of thought among American economists is investigated using   samples of the memberships of the American Economic Association, the   Union for Radical Political Economists and the Association for   Evolutionary Economics. Discriminant analysis reveals a complex web of   theoretical and organizational integration and separatism involving   theoretical orientation in economics, emulative economists, scholarly   research focus, organizational membership, and political values. The   modal radical economist espouses a radical political economic philosophy   and pursues Marxist/radical scholarship in an academic setting. The   modal neoclassical economist, radical in neither disciplinary nor   personal political beliefs, is found, more often than the other types,   in nonacademic administrative work. Marxist/radical and institutionalist   scholarship are mutually exclusive. Other dimensions of the professional   role, as well as a number of social and biographical background   characteristics, do not differentiate between types of economists.

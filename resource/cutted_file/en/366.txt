SO CRITICAL ASIAN STUDIES
AB This article explores two related questions. First, why has Marxist   social theory been in sharp decline? Second, is Marxism still of value   as a source of explanatory insights in the contemporary period? The   author addresses the first question in terms of Marxism's decline as a   specific resource in the study of China and as a general mode of   analysis within social science and he provides a number of   interconnected reasons, based primarily in the sociology of knowledge.   These reasons for decline allow the argument to be made that Marxism   still has something to offer because none of the reasons necessarily   entails that Marxist concepts need lack explanatory relevance. This   leads into the second question where the author explores how the realist   movement in philosophy has been used by Marxists to provide an   analytical underpinning that is compatible with Marx's work and where   the author also discusses some aspects of contemporary China in terms of   Marxist ways of thinking. These are then placed in an international   context. The argument is part of a wider project to develop an applied   philosophy of area studies.

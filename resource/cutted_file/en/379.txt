SO JOURNAL FOR THE THEORY OF SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR
AB This paper advances a theory as to why Vygotsky's research program has   remained at the center of international psychological debates, despite   its grounding in Marxist philosophy. An important part of the   psychological appeal of Vygotsky derives from the fact that lie was   describing the mental constructs and rule-governed behavior of human   development in their account of social, cultural, and historical   reality. There have been a number of attempts to create a Marxist   psychology during the 1920s and 1930s. These have been less successful   because of misunderstandings of Marxism, and indeed of psychology. If   Marxism drew on German Hegelian philosophy, British political economy,   and French political socialism, then psychology drew on German   materialist physiology, British empiricist philosophy, and French   Cartesian dualism. Marx attacked the poverty of philosophy and wrote a   Critique of political economy, similarly, Vygotsky wrote Educational   psychology and attacked the poverty of psychology in his magnum opus,   Historical Meaning of the Crisis in Psychology. Vygotsky argued that we   must write our poverty of psychology, then lay the foundations for a   Marxist psychology. That is to create psychology's own capital.

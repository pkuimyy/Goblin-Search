TI The Significance of Practice for Theory: A Reconstruction of Alasdair
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The term of practice plays an important role in MacIntyre's philosophy.   He uses it in two different ways: either generally as contrasted with   theory, or as a specifically defined term within his   Neo-Aristotelianism. These two meanings are independent from each other.   The paper is a reconstruction of MacIntyre's argument concerning the   notion of practice in its general sense and as related to the concept of   theory. First, it analyses practice as opposed to theory, and its   Marxist roots; second, it outlines the post-Marxist revolutionary   "Benedictine" vision of MacIntyre's Thomistic Aristotelianism, third,   the issue in question is exemplified via the mutual relationship between   political philosophy and politics; finally, several implications of the   author's argument are suggested. The paper claims that those engaged in   elaboration, critique and implementation of political and/or moral   theories may benefit from MacIntyre's insightful account of the   significance of practice for theory.

TI Political science in Croatia 1962-2007
SO EUROPEAN POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB The institutional development of political science in Croatia began in   1962 with the establishment of the Faculty of Political Sciences as the   first academic institution of its kind in the then communist Central and   Eastern Europe. Until the 1990s, this development was underpinned by two   major factors. The first was the feud between the partisans and the   opponents of political science as an independent discipline, which   resulted in a compromise: the faculty was instituted as an organisation   for the interdisciplinary study of economics, sociology, philosophy,   history and political science. The second factor was the dominance of   Marxist political science whose goal was to turn itself into an   'anti-bourgeois', that is, anti-Western political science, even into a   sort of an anti-political science.

TI Monumental Art and Hidden Transcripts of Resistance in Revolutionary
SO JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN CULTURAL STUDIES
AB The transformative ethos underpinning the Cuban Revolution aimed at the   creation of the New Socialist Man as conceived by Che Guevara. This was   to be achieved through the expansion of culture and education and the   instillation of Marxist-Leninist ideology and philosophy of history. As   a materialisation of history, monuments were considered as key devices   for the reification and public spread of the official ideology. This   paper explores how the Cuban Revolution generated a new public   monumental aesthetic resulting from the competing demands of political   commissioners and artists. It argues that artists sustained a hidden   transcript of resistance by promoting abstract art, under the increasing   pressure of the regime to develop a monumental public symbolic and   material space following Soviet realist models. The paper focuses in the   period of higher socio-cultural repression between the mid-1970s and the   start of the Special Period in 1990.

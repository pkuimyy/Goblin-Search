TI Gianni Vattimo: From Weak Thought to Hermeneutics as a "Second Realism"
SO PHILOSOPHY TODAY
AB Since the 1980s, Vattimo's "Weak Thought" has been an emendation of his   previous revolutionary and dialectical reading of Nietzsche. Marxist   terrorism in Europe exposed the indissoluble link between dialectics and   violence, and consequently Vattimo's revision was a rejection of any   reconstructive effort for a new political and social order. But in the   age of Silvio Berlusconi, Vattimo rediscovered the joy of political   commitment. Ecce Comu was a call to pursue "a project of human   emancipation" founded "on the search for equality" More recently, Of   Reality and Hermeneutic Communism are a rejection of neoliberal   philosophies and constitute a jump back to the 1970s. Vattimo aims once   again to change the world and reality, a reality that other philosophies   (Ferraris's New Realism) simply contemplate as a pure fact. Vattimo   defends the "revolutionary" meaning of hermeneutics against realism's   conservative tendencies and develops a project close to Gramsci's   "philosophy of praxis!'

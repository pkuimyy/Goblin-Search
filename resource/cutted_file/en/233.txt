SO PHILOSOPHICAL PAPERS
AB Feminist philosophers and philosophers drawing on the German tradition   of social philosophy have recently converged in stressing the importance   of the concept of reificationfirst explicitly discussed by Gyorgy   Lukacsfor the diagnosis of contemporary social and ethical problems.   However, importing a theoretical framework alien to Lukacs' original   discussion has often led to the conflation of reification with other   social and ethical problems. Here it is argued that a coherent   conception of reification, free of implausible Marxist and idealist   trappings, can be recovered from Lukacs' original discussion of it: the   socially induced distortion of experience such that what is in fact   human action appears as mere natural happening. This phenomenon is to be   distinguished from, firstly, instrumentalising objectification of   persons and, secondly, person-identification failure, with which Martha   Nussbaum and Axel Honneth respectively have equated reification in   recent work. Reification, on the understanding of it recovered here, is   problematic not just because it is an illusion, but also because it can   render moral reasons for action or omission, and grounds of ethical   evaluation, invisible to agents, and, moreover, because it can lead   people to tolerate as inevitable undesirable situations which could in   fact be changed. It can thus ground social criticism.

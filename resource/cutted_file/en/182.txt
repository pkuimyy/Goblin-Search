TI A Twofold Perspective on Research on Marx and Engels' Classic Texts
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB Study of the classic texts of Marx and Engels should employ two   perspectives: Marxist philosophical history and Marxist philosophical   principles. The two cannot be separated, still less contradictory. In   dealing creatively with these classic works, we must firmly uphold the   methodology of historical materialism, read them in accordance with the   authors' original intentions and approach them creatively. We need to   oppose research styles that place undue emphasis on the researcher's own   interpretations and constructions. Research on Marxist philosophy should   develop on the basis of respect, study and correct understanding of Marx   and Engels' classic works; different readings of these texts must not be   allowed to construct a pluralist Marxism. This is of great importance   for consolidating the leading position of Marxism in the sphere of   ideology.

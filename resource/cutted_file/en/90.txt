TI Escaping Structuralism's Legacy: The Renewal of Theory and History in
SO SCIENCE & SOCIETY
AB The project of renewing historical materialist theory for a new   generation requires overcoming the limitations of Althusserian   structuralism. Upon investigation, Althusser's theory is revealed to be   idealist, inconsistent with the philosophy actually articulated by Marx,   and unhelpful in understanding the dynamics of human societies. The   flaws in this approach led both to E. P. Thompson's rejection of   abstract theory altogether, and Michael Lebowitz's effort to "complete"   Marx's theoretical project, while avoiding Althusser's structural   determinism by incorporating agency and social struggle into the heart   of political economy. Yet Lebowitz's theoretical system has very little   to say about how these were historically practiced by classes as   institutional formations in different spatio-temporal contexts. In this   respect, the "Institutional Marxist" approach developed by Leo Panitch   and Sam Gindin shows the most promise for further developing today's   revival of historical materialism.

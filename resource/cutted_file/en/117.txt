TI Understanding the "New Confucianism": Reinventing Confucianism and the
SO ARS & HUMANITAS
AB This article focuses on an important change in Chinese thinking of the   20th century: the rebirth of Confucianism as the intellectual movement   called "New Confucianism" which is considered in the China of today to   be a possible substitute for Marxist ideology. But what exactly is the   "New Confucianism"? The author first attempts to highlight the   definition of Confucianism from the Western perspective and the problems   that arise in that process. The study is based primarily on the work of   Jiang Qing (sic), one of the principal thinkers of this movement of   ideas, and on the analysis of the main western interpreter of Qing,   researcher Daniel Bell. Further along, the paper discusses some of the   most common tags of this movement: New Confucianism as a religion, as a   social doctrine, and as a new political option for the future.   Notwithstanding the elusiveness of the concept it appears to be the case   that this movement is developing spontaneously in modern Chinese society   and is gaining more and more followers, even via a lighter literary   genre through which modified Confucian thoughts and tips for coping with   everyday life can approach a wider crowd.

TI The Ideology in Trattato di Semiotica Generale by Umberto Eco. A put in
SO DESIGNIS
AB Ideology has a theoretical concept, is not usually associated to the   semiotic tradition, but rather to the fields of Philosophy and   Socio-politics. The urge throughout the 70's to construct the concept as   a sense producing mechanism reveal two antagonistic influences: that of   the post-war Marxist debate; and that of the new cultural industry of   which social-sciences have for task to describe and analyse. Eco   introduced the word Ideology as a concept in the third part of Trattato   (TSG) in the section Teoria della Produzione Signica within the frame of   what he defined has "the superior limit of semiotics". The fact that   Ideology can be considered as a system of representation for a social   class, turned into an hegemonic system of comprehension and   representation - in this sense Althusser and Gramsci provide us with   prime definitions - raises many questions for semioticians. Against this   backdrop our reflexion will seek to contrast the different semiotic   conceptions on Ideology with the originality of Eco's approach. Then the   concept dissapear in the next fifty years.

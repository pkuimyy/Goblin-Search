SO PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This article seeks to develop the Marxist conception of social structure   by incorporating developments within critical realist philosophy. It   rejects forms of economic determinism such as the base-superstructure   model and those reconstructions-like Cohen's-that attribute primacy to   productive forces in explaining history and society. It argues instead   that society is the product of complex, often contradictory combinations   of many different structures and mechanisms. They form a structural   ensemble, hierarchically arranged, but where each element has its own   dynamics and emergent powers. It concludes that society is best   understood through critical realist conceptions of stratification,   emergence, transformation, and overdetermination.

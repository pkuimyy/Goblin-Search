AB A variety of pessimistic economic forecasts predicts a long period of   poor growth and continued high levels of unemployment even as the stock   market has reached new highs. Trend extrapolation suggests we can expect   continued rising inequality in income, wealth and political influence.   Because these developments are so visible there was widespread positive   reaction to Occupy Wall Street and its analysis of the causal factors at   work shaping the political economy of the contemporary conjuncture. This   article argues that these developments should inform the work of social   movements and considers the strengths and weaknesses of the Social   Forum/Occupy activists and the socialist/Marxist wings of the broad left   movement and drawing on contributions of selected European theorists   suggests a perspective enabling these poles of the movement to work   together while maintaining, as they must, their different foci and   political philosophy priors.

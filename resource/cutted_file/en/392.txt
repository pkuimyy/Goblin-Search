TI Business ethics in China
SO JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
AB First I briefly review the emergence and development of business ethics,   following three stages (1978-1984; 1984-1994; 1994 to the present) and   driven by four factors: the inheritance of Chinese traditional ethics;   the influence of Marxist philosophy and ethics; the reflections on the   economic reform; and the influence of business ethics from abroad. Then,   from a practical and a theoretical perspective, I discuss the main   challenges for business ethics in China: issues of the economic system,   of corporate ethics, and of management. After commenting on the role of   business ethics for the social development in China, I offer some   reflections about what China can contribute to, and learn from, other   peoples.

TI "SOCIAL ENGINEERING OF THE FUTURE": EVGENIY POLIVANOV ON THE PRINCIPLES
SO EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
AB The article analyzes the project of scientific justification of language   Reforms, realized by the Soviet regime in 20s and 30s, elaborated by   Russian and Soviet linguist Evgenij Polivanov (1891-1938). Polivanov   claims that a Soviet linguist should not limit his interests to the   "general linguistics" and become an active "language builder" and   "language politician". The reforms should be carefully planned by the   experts in language sciences who master as well the methodology of   dialectical materialism. In the polemics against Nikolai Marr's   Japhetidology Polivanov argued that linguistics is a strict science and   its deductions are not contradictory to Marxism, as the latter is   primarily a materialist philosophy. His minimal program consisted in   explaining his views on the evolution of language in the Marxist terms.   The evolution of language is explained by the influence of internal and   external factors. The socio-economical factors are not influencing the   language in a direct manner, but their analysis allows to change the   channel of language evolution. According to Polivanov, the introduction   of Marxism into linguistics will make possible to explain the   relationship between intralinguistic and extralinguistic factors and   will transform the sciences of language into "social engineering of the   future".

SO FOUNDATIONS OF SCIENCE
AB Pieter Lemmens' neo-Marxist approach to technology urges us to rethink   how to do political philosophy of technology. First, Lemmens' high level   of abstraction raises the question of how empirically informed a   political theory of technology needs to be. Second, his dialectical   focus on a "struggle" between humans and technologies reveals the limits   of neo-Marxism. Political philosophy of technology needs to return "to   the things themselves". The political significance of technologies   cannot be reduced to its origins in systems of production or social   organization, but requires study at the micro-level, where technologies   help to shape engagement, interaction, power, and social awareness.

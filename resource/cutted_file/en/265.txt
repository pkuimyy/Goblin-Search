TI The Exception: Force of Argument in Terry Eagleton's William Shakespeare
SO SHAKESPEARE
AB An English text of Carl Schmitt's Hamlet or Hecuba makes it vital to   question the turn from French theory to Germany philosophy in   Shakespeare studies, given a Left flirtation with Schmitt's Political   Theology begun by Walter Benjamin. The Marxist critic's fascination with   fascism was decried by Terry Eagleton as a theoretical error. So it is   ironic that Eagleton's William Shakespeare was driven by the same   Schmittian idea that "sovereign is he who decides the exception'' in   language or law. Eagleton backtracked on its cult of violence after   9/11. But 25 years on, his introduction to the plays shows the danger of   using Shakespeare to decide necessary violence, not least in its own   exceptional force of argument. This article thus considers Eagleton's   book to be an early example of the coincidence of opposites that   currently attracts Shakespeareans to dubious existentialist notions of   decision and risk.

AB It is often claimed that we are currently witnessing a renewal of   Marxism, both at the theoretical and at the practical level. The A's   claim is that, on the contrary, this is the case at neither level. More   precisely, he seeks to show that the two most innovative currents of   contemporary Marxism, the Frankfurt School and rational-choice Marxism,   have recently evolved in a convergent manner towards a relinquishment of   the reference to Marxism. At the same time, both these theoretical   developments allow for new - and non-Marxist - instruments for the   understanding of contemporary social movements and the formulation of   new forms of political philosophy, which are themselves still   surprisingly convergent. The path followed by Jurgen Habermas is   particularly representative of the first of these currents; John Elster   is a significant representative of the second.

TI Indian Philosophy at the Turn of the Millennium
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The 20th century India witnessed quite a strong tendency towards the   separation of philosophy from religion, regarding them as two autonomous   phenomena. This tendency corresponded with a more general endeavor,   namely getting philosophy closer to science. The author focuses   especially on new streams, which appeared by the end of the millennium   and are still relevant today. These include philosophy of science,   feminist philosophy, Gandhian philosophy, postcolonial studies (in terms   of their importance for philosophy) as well as still reverberant   existentialist and Marxist doctrines.

TI An approach to interdisciplinarity from Philosophy
SO MEDISUR-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS MEDICAS DE CIENFUEGOS
AB In the consulted bibliography it is shown the theoretical dimension on   interdisciplinarity is more developed than its practical dimension. It   is understood that developing interdisciplinarity from practice requires   singling out its projection from the academic year staff and discipline   staff which integrate a given curriculum. The discipline staff of   Philosophy and Society put into practice an interdisplinary approach   from its own discipline, applied to the first year of the medical major   taking advantage of the possibilities offered by its broad application   to all disciplines. The results achieved are exposed and recommendations   on the Marxist Leninist role to set a dialectic rupture with content   presentation by parts, in fragmented way and in many cases   decontextualized from the students' living reality. The paper is aimed   at showing the possibilities the discipline Philosophy and Society has   to strengthen the practical dimension of interdisciplinarity.

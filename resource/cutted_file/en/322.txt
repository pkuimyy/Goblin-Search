AB This article explores the tension between history and salvation as theme   in contemporary social and humanist philosophy. Special reference is   made to Emmanuel Levinas' work in order to delineate the scope of the   questions involved, and to critically elucidate the position on history,   death and hope in new-Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch.

SO ADULT EDUCATION QUARTERLY
AB This study's goal is to uncover the contradictions inherent in the   philosophy and practice of the learning organization. Through a   Marxist-feminist analysis of recent shifts in adult education and   workplace structure, this study attempts to uncover the function of the   learning organization in the capitalist political economy, the location   of workers in relation to the learning organization, and the role of   learning rhetoric in maintaining the status quo. This study argues that   the learning organization model can be seen both as a mechanism for the   extraction of surplus value from workers and as a method of social   control. The learning organization model is often associated with   progressive, even emancipatory, claims of inclusion and collaboration in   the workplace. However, this study argues that the educational legacies   of feminism, trade unionism, antiracism, and revolutionary struggle are   better places to seek the learning interests of the workers that make up   the learning organization.

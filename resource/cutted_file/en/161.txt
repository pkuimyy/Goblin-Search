TI NEOKANTIANISM AND PLATONISM IN NEOHELLENIC PHILOSOPHY
SO JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
AB 'Neokantianism and Platonism' indicates an important issue of   Neo-Hellenic Philosophy during the 1920s and the 1930s. The protagonist   was Johannes Theodorakopoulos. His Heidelberg dissertation Platons   Dialektik des Seins (1927) follows the Neokantian theories of judgement   (of Emil Lask and Heinrich Rickert) and explores Plato's theory of   judgement with emphasis on Philebos' categories of peras and apeiron.   Theodorakopoulos' prolegomena to the Greek translation (1929) of Paul   Natorp's Platos Ideenlehre are relevant here. Nevertheless,   Theodorakopoulos developed a personal interpretation of Plato's   philosophy and almost demoted the Neokantian interpretation, as is clear   in his Introduction to Plato (1941, in Greek) as also in his Heidelberg   Vorlesungen 1969 entitled Die Hauptprobleme der Platonischen   Philosophic.   Besides, other interpretations of Plato came forward. Evangelos   Papanoutsos wrote his Tubingen dissertation Das religiose Erlebnis bei   Platon (1926) under the supervision of Adickes. Konstantinos Georgoules,   an earlier student of Husserl and Heidegger, published a translation of   Plato's Politeia (1939, in Greek) with a rather philological   introduction. The Marxist Demetres Glenos, an opponent of Neokantianism,   proposed a realistic interpretation of Plato's Sophistes (1939, in   Greek). Basileios Tatakes (an adherent of Henri Bergson) presented   Plato's philosophy as a reconciliation of reason and mysticism.

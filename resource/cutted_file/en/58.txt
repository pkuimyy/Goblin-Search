TI THINGS WITHOUT WORDS, TOTALITY WITHOUT THE PRIVATE. THE SOVIET
SO LOGOS
AB What is the "Soviet trauma" in philosophy? We consider the case of Evald   Ilyenkov, a Marxist who stood against positivism and physicalism in   understanding the human mind. Ilyenkov discussed the political and   socio-anthropological consequences of positivism, both for the West and   the Soviet system. Ilyenkov's social and methodological criticism is   based on his pedagogical theory of personality and presupposes a utopia   of the full personal appropriation of the universal. His pedagogy is a   mix of materialistic psychology and transcendental philosophy.   Ilyenkov's pedagogical utopia is also a key to his political utopia.   According to Ilyenkov, only a cultural revolution that moves beyond   socialism will overcome alienation. He understood the alienation of   human beings as an alienation from the total nature of mankind.   Alienation is a product of private property in a broad sense. The   principle of private property implies a positivist logic, which in its   turn produces technocratism. Ilyenkov opposes the scientistic logic of   adding up particular facts to the dialectic logic of proceeding from the   whole. The rightly educated person reconstitutes the whole and   transgresses the principle of particularity. The last principle is   considered as the main feature and the main vice of modern society.   Ilyenkov avoided the question whether any mode of power (and violence)   is produced by this logic of the whole. To investigate this question, we   invoke Ilyenkov's works that previously have not been considered as   having political meaning. Based on this extended corpus, we try to   reconstruct Ilyenkov's system of political philosophy.

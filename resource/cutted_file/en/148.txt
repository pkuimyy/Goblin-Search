TI Ideology-Critique with the Conceptual Hinterland of a Theory of the
SO CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY
AB The ideology-theoretical turn' of the late 1970s and 1980s claimed a   re-foundation of Marxist research into ideology, which was stuck in   several respects. Its attempt to overcome the traditional fixation on a   criticism of false' consciousness is still valid. It led, however, in   particular in the tradition of the Althusser School, to an over-general   notion of ideology that repressed the radical and critical impulses of   Marx and Engels' concept of ideology. Going deliberately against the   grain of a predominant tendency in secondary literature, which places   Marx/Engels' and Gramsci's concepts of ideology on opposite poles of the   spectrum, the essay shows that the strength of the respective approaches   lies in their particular combination of ideology-critique and   ideology-theory. The dichotomy of these strands is misguided and   counterproductive and needs to be overcome by the renewal of an   ideology-critique which is informed and backed up by a materialist   theory of the ideological.

TI Norbert Elias's post-philosophical sociology: from 'critique' to
SO SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW
AB This paper argues that Elias's work presupposes a radical abandonment of   philosophy as a vestige of magical-mythical thinking that has been   rendered obsolete by the rise of sociology. For Elias, attempts by   philosophers to claim a continuing non-empirical area of investigation   are spurious and reflect only professional interests. The origins of   Elias's position are traced to his rejection of neo-Kantianism and his   participation in the Wissenssoziologie of Karl Mannheim in Weimar   Germany. Focusing on the traditional ethical or normative questions, the   paper shows how Elias's conception of the 'detour via detachment'   enabled him to transcribe these issues (as well as traditional   epistemological and ontological questions) into sociologically   manageable terms. His strategy is further clarified through a comparison   with the all-pervasive Critical Sociology approach to these matters,   which emerges as severely handicapped by its reliance upon   quasi-metaphysical, transcendental arguments. Also, its attributions of   social blame generate fear images that reinforce conflict and its   negative over-statements strengthen anxiety and frustration, thereby   bolstering precisely what it is trying to change. The paper reveals the   tacit function as a leftist code-word that the term 'critical' performs   for many sociologists. Neo-Marxist 'critique' is shown to be a   profoundly flawed attempt to deal with issues of theory and practice.

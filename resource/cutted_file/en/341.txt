TI Leon Rosenfeld's Marxist defense of complementarity
SO HISTORICAL STUDIES IN THE PHYSICAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AB The Belgian physicist Leon Rosenfeld (1904-1974) has been called "the   clarifier" of Niels Bohr's ideas in quantum mechanics. He had a unique   connection to Bohr as his close collaborator from 1930 until Bohr died   in 1962. However, although he is considered Bohr's spokesman, he had his   own characteristic way of articulating Bohr's views. In particular,   Rosenfeld added a dialectical-materialist layer to Bohr's ideas in   certain contexts. Despite Rosenfeld's open profession of Marxism, the   literature has generally avoided discussing its relevance for his work   and activities. This paper suggests some reasons why and investigates   Rosenfeld's combination of Marxism and complementarity, which his   colleague and friend Wolfgang Pauli metaphorically denoted by the   equation "Rosenfeld =root TrotskyXBohr" Rosenfeld's particular views   appear anomalous to the frequently expressed stereotypes of both Marxism   and complementarity. The paper concentrates on the role Marxist   philosophy played in Rosenfeld's fierce defense of complementarity from   the late 1940s through the 1950s and the reception his campaign was   accorded at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and elsewhere.

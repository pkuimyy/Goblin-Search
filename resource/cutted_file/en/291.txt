TI Heroism and history in Merleau-Ponty's existential phenomenology
SO CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY REVIEW
AB Whereas Phenomenology of Perception concludes with a puzzling turn to   "heroism," this article examines the short essay "Man, the Hero" as a   source of insight into Merleau-Ponty's thought in the early postwar   period. In this essay, Merleau-Ponty presented a conception of heroism   through which he expressed the attitude toward post-Hegelian philosophy   of history that underwrote his efforts to reform Marxism along   existential lines. Analyzing this conception of heroism by unpacking the   implicit contrasts with KojSve, Aron, Caillois, and Bataille, I show   that its philosophical rationale was to supply experiential evidence   attesting to the latent presence of human universality. It is a mythic   device intended to animate the faith necessary for Marxist politics by   showing that universal sociality is possible, and that the historically   transformative praxis needed to realize it does not imply sacrifice.   This sheds considerable light on Merleau-Ponty's early postwar political   thought. But inasmuch as the latter cannot be severed from his broader   philosophical concerns, the prospect is raised that his entire   phenomenological project in the early postwar period rested on a myth.   Not necessarily a bad myth, but a myth nonetheless.

TI Fanning the spark of hope in the past: The British Marxist historians
SO RETHINKING HISTORY
AB Walter Benjamin wrote in his Theses in the Philosophy of History: 'Only   that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the   past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from   the enemy [the ruling class] if he wins. And the enemy has not ceased to   be victorious'. The British Marxist historians - such as Rodney Hilton,   Christopher Hill, Victor Kiernan, George Rude, E.P. Thompson, Eric   Hobsbawm - had that gift. Possessed with Marx's grand hypothesis that   'The history of all hitherto existing societies has been the history of   class struggle', and committed to recovering the past 'from the bottom   up', especially the experiences, struggles and aspirations of the   working classes, the British Marxist historians refashioned the history   of the making of the modern world in a critical and democratic manner.   This essay reviews their collective contributions to historiography and   political thought, and considers their intellectual legacy in view of   the historical and political challenges of the Twenty-first century. The   author recognizes that we will have to ask new questions of past and   present and develop new means of connecting our labours to popular   historical memory, consciousness and imagination; but he argues that -   if we, too, are to 'fan the spark of hope in the past' contra those who   would declare the end of history - we would do well to appreciate the   gifts of the British Marxist historians.

TI The Chinese Logic of Consultative Governance
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB Contemporary China needs to change from a Western to a Chinese-style   governance discourse so as to form and explore a consultative governance   discourse with Chinese characteristics. This is profoundly evident in   the following: the Marxist philosophy of the state is the theoretical   premise of contemporary China's consultative governance; traditional   Chinese thought on governance and practice are the soil in which   contemporary Chinese consultative governance grows; socialism with   Chinese characteristics is the realm in which contemporary Chinese   consultative governance exists; the masses under the leadership of the   CPC are the necessary subjects of contemporary Chinese consultative   governance; and the target of contemporary Chinese consultative   governance is a multi-layered and diverse existence. Realization of   national governance through consultative democracy is the basic form of   contemporary Chinese consultative governance; the balanced development   of public, collective and individual interests is the basic objective of   contemporary Chinese consultative governance; the basic principles of   contemporary Chinese consultative governance are equality, inclusiveness   and peace; and the criteria for assessing contemporary Chinese   consultative governance are authority, consensus, institutions and the   rule of law. Guided by the Marxist view of the state, rooted in the   tradition of China's fine political culture, and founded on the   theoretical and practical claims of socialism with Chinese   characteristics, socialist consultative governance with Chinese   characteristics constitutes the Chinese form of contemporary governance   theory.

TI Enrico Ferri's scientific socialism: A marxist interpretation of Herbert
SO JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY
AB Spencer's evolutionary philosophy is usually identified with right-wing   doctrines such as individualism, laissez-faire liberalism and even   conservatism. Since he himself defended similar positions, it is perhaps   not surprising that the study of the political interpretations of his   ideas has drawn relatively little attention. In this article I propose   to examine a rather atypical reading of Spencer's organic analogy,   though definitely not a marginal one: Enrico Ferri's Marxist doctrine of   Scientific Socialism. Ferri is not a figure unknown to scholars   interested in the political aspects of the evolutionary debate.   Nonetheless, the relation between his theory and Spencer's bio-sociology   - notably the complex dialectic of themes such as "the struggle for   existence" versus "class struggle," or "evolution" versus "revolution" -   has not yet received full-length analysis. In my study I investigate the   diffusion of Spencer's ideas in Italy and their impact on the new   "positivist" sciences of psychology and sociology inasmuch as these   questions are essential to understanding Ferri's position. Throughout, I   stress the importance of the intellectual and political context in the   process of appropriation of ideas that led to this unexpected shift in   meaning.

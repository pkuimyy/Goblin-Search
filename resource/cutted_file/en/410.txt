AU KUKOC, M
TI THE WORLDS RECEPTION OF THE CONTEMPORARY CROATIAN PHILOSOPHY
SO DRUSTVENA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The international affirmation of contemporary Croatian philosophy is   connected with the journals which have presented, each of them in its   period, the two most productive generations of modern Croatian   philosophers. The first established Praxis with the well-known procede   of neomarxism of the humanistic provenance, which responded to the   temporal trends of the mid-twentieth century modernism. In contrast to   the one-dimensional marxist praxis-orientation, the journal of the   second generation - Filozofska istrazivanja (Philosophical   Investigations) - was profiled as a fruitful debate of a critical and   creative spirit, open in the direction of theoretical pluralism, toward   new reflective orientations, toward new topics and ideas. Through its   international edition titled Synthesis philosophica, the journal,   together with its authors, has also achieved international success.

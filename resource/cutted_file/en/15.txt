TI THE END OF AESTHETICS AND THE NEW ART CRITIQUE IN BENJAMIN
SO KRITERION-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
AB The article aims to show how Benjamin's effort to found a new art   criticism goes back to the first romanticism of Iena and to Hegel's   philosophy. While Hegel proclaims the end of aesthetics and of the   traditional work of art, the romantics, in the figure of F. Schlegel and   Novalis, point to the continuation of a philosophical art discourse that   ignores the traditional presuppositions, using concepts such as immanent   criticism and medium-of-reflection. Based on that, this article seeks to   show how this double heritage remains throughout the main works of   Benjamin, especially the "German Tragic Drama" and the work of the   "Passages", at the center of which is the concept of montage. Finally,   resorting to Marxist influence, the text outlines some political   consequences of this art criticism that, developed from youth, remains   in the texts of maturity.

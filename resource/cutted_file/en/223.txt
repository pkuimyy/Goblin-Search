TI Goethe and Hegel in the Commissariat of Enlightenment: Anatoly
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB The study of the processes and methods through which elements of   Hegelian philosophy and aesthetics have been appropriated and adjusted   to the needs of Marxist-Leninist criticism is essential for   understanding Bolshevik-Marxist aesthetics in the process of its   consolidation into an official doctrine in Soviet Russia. By looking at   the career of the Bolshevik Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoly   Lunaarskij, it is possible to discern the extent to which the process   was forged by the unsanctioned presence of Goethe and Hegel. The article   traces their important contributions in the causes of sustaining   revolutionary romanticism and its eventual overcoming in favor of the   rationality and solemnity of socialist realism.

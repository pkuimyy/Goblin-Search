TI Criticism of the Logic of the Ecological Imperialism of "Carbon
SO SOCIAL SCIENCES IN CHINA
AB Within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on   Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, international carbon politics   inevitably presents itself as the logic or essence of "ecological   imperialism," reflecting a few Western countries' expansion and   development of their historically formed international hierarchical   superiority or exclusive hegemony on the basis of their domestic   capitalist economies and politics. This is an intrinsic obstacle to   creating a more equitable, democratic and effective global climate or   environmental governance system. Criticism of international carbon   politics and its " ecological imperialism," based on traditional   "green-left" theories from Marxist philosophy and political economy,   provides a theoretical basis for seeking an alternative way to cope with   global climate change effectively. As a responsible developing country,   China's response to climate change is not only an internal requirement   for the promotion of its own sustainable development, but also reflects   its responsibility to create a community of shared future for mankind.   This rationale for our time determines that it is necessary for China to   become a world leader in coping with global climate change and   environmental governance through a leadership which lies in making a   contribution rather than fighting for hegemony.

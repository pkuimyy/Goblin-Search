TI Gyorgy Lukacs 1902-1918: His way to Marx
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB At the end of his life Gyorgy Lukacs described his intellectual career   as 'my way to Marx' [mein Weg zu Marx]. By this he meant that his   professional life can be interpreted as an attempt to get to the real   Marx. In this paper I use this expression in a narrower and more direct   meaning: I attempt to present the road at the end of which the young   Lukacs arrived at a Marxist standpoint.

TI Reflections on critical realism in political economy
SO CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
AB This paper studies critical realism in political economy. The focal   points are two important tensions in critical realism. The first tension   relates generally to the status and importance of philosophy and the   scope of critical realism. The second tension relates specifically to   critical realism in political economy. Firstly, two perspectives within   critical realism in political economy are separated: a Marxist current   and a broad heterodox current. Secondly, these two perspectives within   critical realism are contrasted and discussed on the basis of a critical   stance towards philosophical reductionism. Thirdly, it is argued that   reconciliation between central aspects of the two perspectives is both   feasible and desirable, and finally, neo-Marxist political economy is   pinpointed as a critical-constructive and developmental mediation for   critical realism in political economy.

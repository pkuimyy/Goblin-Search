TI Marx and Industrial Age Aesthetics of Alienation
SO CULTURA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF CULTURE AND AXIOLOGY
AB Karl Marx's socio-economic analysis of capitalism and the conditions of   industrial production are meant to imply the competitive alienation of   workers in at least two important senses: (1) Workers are alienated from   their tools and materials because under capitalism they generally do not   own, develop or cultivate the means of production or market for products   themselves; and (2) Workers are alienated from one another in   competitive isolation prior to the evolution of assembly-line production   in the classical progression of capitalist manufacturing. The present   essay develops two main aspects of the art of alienation in this   characteristically Marxist aesthetic directly influenced by Marx, as   opposed to existential or atheistic among other kinds of alienation.   Focus is placed on Marx's PhD dissertation and Philosophical and   Economic Manuscripts of 1844, as a reflection of the state of social   life, philosophical perspectives on the human condition, in a time of   mechanization, consumerism and godless materialism. The history of   artistic developments offers independent confirmation of Marx's   thematization of alienation objectifying itself as a sign of the times   in artistic production and aesthetic theory.

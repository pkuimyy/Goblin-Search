TI Empowering students: A pragmatic philosophical approach to management
SO MANAGEMENT LEARNING
AB This paper explores issues concerning the empowerment of students of   management. In so doing, analogies are drawn between empowerment in   particular educational and managerial contexts. There is a focus on the   relationship between the educational implications of empowering students   and the post-educational experiences of interacting within, more often   than not, hierarchical organizations. The author acknowledges the   contradictions he feels exist and the disquiet these contradictions lead   to in his purporting to practise student empowerment in what he   personally experiences as a disempowering world. Consequently he employs   the writing of a wide range of authors to deconstruct his own   experiences as a lecturer in a school of management. Reference is made   to personal experience, and underlying issues are explored through the   thoughts of writers from the following traditions: neo-Lukacsian,   determinist-Marxist existential, radical and postmodern. The aim is not   to provide prescriptive answers but to adopt a philosophical approach in   the sense of philosophy as a 'battle against the bewitchment of our   intelligence by means of language' (Cooper, 1990: 21). The suggestion is   that educationalists have too readily 'talked into existence' the   concept of empowerment without sufficient investigation into the nature   of empowerment as an empirical reality.

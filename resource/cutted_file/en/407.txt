TI THE PHILOSOPHICAL POLITICS OF LYOTARD,JEAN,FRANCOIS
SO PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB The systematic philosophical foundation for Jean-Francois Lyotard's   postmodern and post-Marxist politics is described. The central principle   of the right to create different ''phrases'' is uncovered and examined.   The political consequences of this philosophical system are explored,   leading to the conclusion that Lyotard's commitment to difference leads   to political indifference. The philosophical roots of this indifference   are detailed in Lyotard's Cartesian starting point and his analysis of   Holocaust revisionism. This analysis reveals an idealist basis to   Lyotard's philosophy of difference. Lyotard's concept of difference is   compared to that of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe.

TI Adolfo Sanchez Vazquez's Philosophy
SO REVISTA DE HISPANISMO FILOSOFICO
AB The present text tries to present this reflexive critical approach to   the ideas of Marx that Sanchez Vazquez creates starting from an   interpretation of the Theses on Feuerbach and especially the relation   between praxis and knowledge, included in exemplary way within this   analysis. The concept of praxis, as it introduces Sanchez Vazquez in   Latin America, overcomes then the generalized dominant idea that the   theory must guide the action, when making understandable that praxis   means the double presence of theory and action in the same moment and in   the same person. This concept, of central importance for Marx, but   forgotten by many Marxists in the first half of century twenty, achieves   to establish the necessary theoretical bases for to surpass the ideology   and reality of a leader or central committee who's are predestined to   guide the blind masses without falling in a false indifference according   to which every one has its own truth. That would be, in the final   analysis, an apparently open and tolerant truth, but without any cutting   edge for to face seriously the over helming and nearly omnipresent   falsenesses about the apparently actuality of the capitalist form of   reproduction.

TI Henryk Grossman and Critical Theory
SO HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB In 1943, Henryk Grossman sent a draft of the study, eventually published   in two parts as The Evolutionist Revolt against Classical Economics', to   Max Horkheimer for comment. His very hostile response, Grossman's drafts   and the published study cast light not only on the changing relationship   between Grossman and Horkheimer but also on the distance between   Grossman's classical Marxism and nascent mature Critical Theory.   Grossman's study identified the emergence of the idea of successive   economic systems in the work of Condorcet, Henri Saint-Simon and Simonde   de Sismondi in France, James Steuart and Richard Jones in England,   culminating in Marx's formulations which entailed the role of class   struggle and capitalism's tendency to break down. Hegel was not an   influence on Marx's conception of modes of production. In addition to a   series of spurious and minor criticisms, Horkheimer objected that   Grossman's approach was positivist, that it misconceived Hegel's   philosophy, and that it amounted to a conventional history of ideas. In   response, Grossman made some changes in his study, but these were   designed to strengthen his main arguments and successfully reaffirmed   his Marxist approach in the face of Horkheimer's criticisms.

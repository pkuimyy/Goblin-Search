TI Consciousness and conscience: Mamardasvili on the common point of
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB Mamardasvili did not develop a systematic philosophy that treats   separately the various traditional disciplines of philosophy such as   epistemology, logic, ethics, aesthetics etc. On the contrary, isolated   from the direct influences of other currents of thought that might   other-wise have given his own a different direction, Mamardasvili   concentrated his attention on the very act of thought, the vitality of   which had been undermined in philosophical understandings, including   both Hegelian-Marxist attempts to situate the subject in history and   re-appropriations of the Cartesian cogito. In this paper I will outline   the most pertinent elements of Mamardasvili's attempt to find a unified   subject of knowledge and action and attempt to show how in his view   consciousness and conscience are indissoluble.

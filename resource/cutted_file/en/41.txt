TI PIERRE KLOSSOWSKI'S HAMANN: THE TRANSITION FROM EPISTEMOLOGY TO SPEECH
SO IDEALISTIC STUDIES
AB This paper elucidates Pierre Klossowski's relationship to the   post-Kantian tradition, specifically as a part of the shift in   twentieth-century French philosophy from a neo-Kantian epistemological   approach to the emphasis on the primacy of language in the human subject   and his place in society. In response to a variety of events (the   reception of Hegelianism through the lenses of Kojeve and Wahl, the   Marxist critique of capitalism and the rise of European fascism)   Klossowski develops a peculiar interest in the works of Johann Georg   Hamann, who can be considered to be either the first post-Kantian or the   direct antecedent of post-Kantianism (given the fact that he influenced   both Kant and many post-Kantians). As this paper argues, Klossowski   published a collection of texts by Hamann as a direct response to the   philosophical deadlock between conceptuality and immediate life that the   French reception of Hegel emphasized.

TI On Theorizing a "Properly Marxist" Musical Aesthetics
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF THE AESTHETICS AND SOCIOLOGY OF MUSIC
AB This essay gives a sympathetic critique of several of the Marxist   writings of the American music theorist Henry Klumpenhouwer (Late   Capitalism, Late Marxism, and the Study of Music, Post-structuralism and   Issues of Music Theory, and Commodity Form, Disavowal, and the Practices   of Music Theory.). This critique is then used as a springboard for   launching some programmatic suggestions about future Marxist music   scholarship.

AB Marxism in Contemporary Russia How can we describe the status of both   Marxian and Marxist research in post-Soviet Russia in the last decade?   Marxists still have an audience; they are part of the political   philosophy of contemporary Russia, but their works enjoy very limited   attention. The school that deserves most attention is that of "critical   Marxism", whose leader is the economist A. V. Buzgalin, which aims at   representing the contemporary form of Marxism. It is close to the   sociological approach of the political science theorist B. Y.   Kagarlitsky. This critical Marxism is ruthless towards the Soviet era,   but also tough on contemporary capitalism. The problems adressed by the   philosophy of history and of theory of culture receive an original   treatment in V. M. Mezhuev. More globally, contemporary Marxist   researches, however vehement in their criticism of the Soviet period,   use Marxist concepts to study current social issues, both in Russia and   in the world in general.

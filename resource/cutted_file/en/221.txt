TI DENKWEG. THE PATH OF THIKING BY MIMMO PALADINO
SO RIVISTA DI ESTETICA
AB Mimmo Paladino's artistic research is characterized by an interest in   the language and the relationship between "individual" and "community".   The idea of "individual" Paladino focuses in his work on is placed in   the Mediterranean culture, and carries with itself the request of social   emancipation that can be ascribable to some Marxist topics - and the   faith in the magical power. Along this route Paladino meets Ernesto De   Martino's South and Magic, Marcel Mauss and Claude Levi-Strauss's works.   With the same naturalness he makes coincide his sign with those of   Matisse and Beuys, overlaps conceptually Spinoza to Jarry, Giordano   Bruno to Beuys by getting the common trait in the transgressive   dimension. It would be misleading trying to get a unitary route at all   costs because only in the idea of the "encounter" apparently causal,   that recalls the impracticable and audacious routes of Hegel's   Phenomenology of Spirit, we can get the meaning of the Paladino's   contaminations with philosophy.

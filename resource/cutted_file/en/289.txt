TI Ren Jiyu: The Marxist View of Chinese Philosophy and Religion Editors'
SO CONTEMPORARY CHINESE THOUGHT
AB The world of Chinese philosophy witnessed an ideological storm that   raged for almost four decades in the second half of the twentieth   century, and Ren Jiyu (1916-2009) was a leading figure in it. The   Marxist interpretation of traditional Chinese thought in terms of five   scientifically determined historical stages, an economic substructure   with its ideological superstructure, and a continuous struggle between   materialism and idealism, was like a whirlwind that came and went in   Chinese academia. This interpretive framework for the study of Chinese   philosophy dominated the field between the 1950s and the 1980s, when it   was rapidly marginalized. Now that the winds have subsided and the   Marxist straitjacket has become much looser, scholars of Chinese thought   and historians interested in the twentieth century have something to   reflect upon: the nature, the impact, and the value of Marxist   intellectuals. How were differences of opinion expressed and treated   within the boundaries of what was ideologically acceptable? How did   views emerge, evolve, and loosen within this period? This selection of   six influential articles written by Ren Jiyu give an insight into these   questions coining from one particular voice.

TI Stalin and Marxism: A research note
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB This article concerns the research done by the author in Stalin's   private library. The notes made in the works of Marx, Engels and Lenin   suggest that until the end of his life Stalin felt himself in general   agreement with these ''classics.'' The choice of books and the notes   support the thesis that, despite his historical interest and his   identification with some of the tsars as powerful rulers, Stalin always   continued to consider himself a Marxist, and that he was uninterested in   other systems of thought, including those of traditional Russia.

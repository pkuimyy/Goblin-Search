TI Mathematics, religion, and Marxism in the Soviet Union in the 1930s
SO HISTORIA MATHEMATICA
AB Mathematicians and traditional pure mathematics in the U.S.S.R. came   under attack in the 1930s from the platforms of religion and nationalism   in attempts to establish dialectical materialist mathematics. These   platforms came to light at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist   Party in 1930. A leader of the attacks was the mathematically inclined   Marxist/Stalinist ideolog Ernst Kolman (1892-1979), in whose writings   randomness and probability (more amenable to philosophical discourse   than other areas of mathematics) are recurring issues. The recently   rediscovered booklet Mathematics and Religion, written in 1933 under the   influence of Kolman by the mathematician and political activist Mikhail   Kh. Orlov (1900-1936), encompasses the Bolshevik position on mathematics   and religion. A nucleus of vilification in Orlov's book for his   religiously inclined pre-revolutionary writings is the mathematician   Pavel Alekseevich Nekrasov (1853-1924), and by extension, the Moscow   Mathematical Society, a focus of attack by Kolman and others. The   attacks, and especially the probabilistic aspects are studied below   under a sequence of headings: Mathematics and the 16th Party Congress;   Moscow Mathematical Society; Nekrasov's Probability and Social Physics;   Politically Correct Probability; Politically Correct Statistics?; Orlov,   Religion, and Mathematics; Orlov and Kolman on Religion and Mathematics.   There are biographical appendices on Kolman and Orlov. The outstanding   mathematician/probabilists of the time, Andrei N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)   and Sergei N. Bernstein (1880-1968), were prominent among the obstacles   to the "reforms" of Kolman (in Moscow) and Orlov (in Ukraine),   respectively, and feature in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

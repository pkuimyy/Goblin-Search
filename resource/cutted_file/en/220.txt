TI Hegel's geographical thought
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE
AB This paper sketches out the contours of the philosopher G W F Hegel's   geographical thought. Until now, geographers have shown little interest   in Hegel's geographical writing. He has figured minimally in histories   of geography, and critical geographers who have engaged with Hegel have   done so indirectly, either through Karl Marx's work or through Marxist   and postcolonial scholars' readings of Hegel. This paper offers a more   direct reading. It begins from an understanding of geographical thought   as both an intellectual and a practical endeavor with its own distinct   historical geographies. It examines Hegel's concepts of 'nature' (Natur)   and 'space' (Raum); his understanding of geography's relationship to   history and anthropology; his relationship to Carl Ritter and Alexander   von Humboldt; and the significance of 'territory' in his political   philosophy. It highlights the ambiguity that characterized Hegel's   thinking about geography, especially in his discussion of climate's   influence on humans. It also challenges Henri Lefebvre's reading of   Hegel's view on the state's relationship to territory. Finally, it   suggests that Hegel's conceptions of nature, space, and geography   mattered not only for his philosophies of history, nature, and   subjective spirit, but for his understanding of modernity's geographies   as well.

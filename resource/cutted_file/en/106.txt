TI LI ZEHOU'S VIEW ON CHINESE MODERNIZATION AND THE PRECARIOUS RELATIONSHIP
SO PROBLEMOS
AB Li Zehou is one of the most significant and influential Chinese   philosophers of our time and one of the rare Chinese intellectuals whose   work has acquired a wide readership abroad. He dedicated himself to the   task of finding a sensible, suitable way of harmonizing past and   present, tradition and modernity, China and the West. In this context,   he tried to create a synthesis between early Marxist and classical   Confucian discourses. Through a critical analysis of these attempts, the   present article reveals some crucial theoretical problems underlying   such efforts. Considering the fact that in contemporary China, the link   between Confucian and Marxist philosophy is a much discussed (and rather   controversial) topic, the paper also represents a contribution to the   clarification of this topical problem.

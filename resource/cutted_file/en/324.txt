TI Sartre and Marxism
SO FILOSOFIA UNISINOS
AB The article analyzes Sartre's thought in its relationship with Marxism.   It discusses his theses, the critique by the would-be Marxists to him,   as well their refutation of these. Additionally, it points to the limits   and contributions of this philosopher to Marxism. The general conclusion   is that Sartre's existentialism makes an important contribution to   Marxism and should, therefore, be reassessed by Marxist theory,   particularly his analysis of freedom and project, which are essential   elements of Sartre's philosophy.

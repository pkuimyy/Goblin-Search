AB The article deals with the reception of Hegel's aesthetics in the   philosophical community of State Academy of Arts in the 1920s. At the   center of the discussion about Hegel in GAKhN is the problem of the   ontology of art, presented by G. Shpet in his works. Under this ontology   Shpet gives a non-metaphysical interpretation of Hegel's aesthetics.   There, art is interpreted as an autonomous mode of cultural existence as   "detached" or "aesthetic" reality. In characterizing this type of   reality Shpet refers to two Hegel's definitions of art: (1) this reality   is determined as an aesthetic "appearance" or "quasi-reality", in   contrast to the pragmatic reality, and (2) this reality does not exist   by itself and must be recognized by humans. Thus, there is some freedom   in the definition of "aesthetic reality". Shpet's philosophy of art,   based on the principles of Hegel's aesthetics, is an alternative to   Marxist aesthetics which dominates at the turn of the 1920s-30s.

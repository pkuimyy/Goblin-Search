TI On Marxist Ethics
SO JOURNAL OF CRITICAL REALISM
AB A new collection of essays edited by Michael J. Thompson aims to   explicate and defend the humanist values which, according to the   authors, were the core of Marx's critique of capitalist society. The   text does not aim to provide a political roadmap to building an   alternative society in which those values could be realized but rather   philosophical analysis of the meaning and implications of those values.   While there are sometimes tensions between the philosophical arguments   developed in the various essays that make up the text and the traditions   of Marxist political practice, the book as a whole certainly proves that   the human values of Marx's philosophy are central to his politics and   that his emancipatory vision remains relevant, even necessary.

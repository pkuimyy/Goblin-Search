TI Another Marxism: a delimitation of Analytical Marxism
SO HETERODOX VIEWS ON ECONOMICS AND THE ECONOMY OF THE GLOBAL SOCIETY
AB Gerald A. Cohen initiated Analytical Marxism in defending historical   materialism on the basis of analytical philosophy and of logical   positivism. This school of thought presented itself as an attempt to   renew Marxism with non-Marxist methodological tools. John Roemer   extended it in reconstructing Marxian economics with neoclassical tools   and Jon Elster generalised it in interpreting Marxism with   methodological individualism and Rational Choice Theory. This paper   deals with the assumption that Analytical Marxism turned Marxism into   its opposite.

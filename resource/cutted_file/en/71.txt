TI THE FIRST TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE AESTHETIC METHODOLOGY, THE INFLUENCE OF
SO ART-SANAT
AB The term of aesthetic was put forward by German philosopher A.G.   Baumgarten in the mid-18th century. Since Baumgarten in the historical   process, the way aesthetic philosophy came into existence, process of   its methodology, hypothetical principles and scientific methods have   always been based on the methodology of philosophy. At this point, some   philosophers have been determinative to change the general methodology   and perspective of aesthetics. Thus, by virtue of these theorists   aesthetics have philosophical characteristics and their sources,   targets, metaphysical processes and methodologies have been   institutionalized.   The thought of aesthetics made progress in the 18th century when art was   theoretically and historically analyzed. This progress was made   especially because of certain philosophers. Hegel, Kant and Marx can be   given as examples. Kant based the terms of aesthetics, aesthetic   experience and beauty totally on subjective basis and with the dialectic   of aesthetic judgment power he introduced the perception of criticism to   aesthetics and art. Hegel doctrinated art in the light of modern   philosophy and introduced the concepts such as talent and technique to   the field of aesthetics. While these philosophers systematized the   aesthetics, after 1940s materialist Marxist dialectic replaced the   Hegelian dialectic. Marx was the architect of this change.   In this study, the aim is to put forward the general laws of aesthetic   philosophy, understanding of aesthetic and art in the conversation   process of aesthetic process into an idealistic materialistic dialectic   and its relationship with other fields of art.

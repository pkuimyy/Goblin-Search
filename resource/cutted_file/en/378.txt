AB This article examines Hegel's view of love in his "early theological   writing," "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate," where he saw love   as a basis of autonomy in the modem self which could overcome the   divisions between reason and emotion, self and other and finite and   infinite. The article also examines Hegel's attempt in the essay to come   to grips with why a community of love cannot be sustained by modem   individuals. Consideration of this essay is seen to be valuable because   of the insight it offers into the nature of the modem subjectivity. Even   more importantly, it throws a different perspective on the mature Hegel.   Contrary to the feminist view of Hegel as basing his political community   on a reason that is exclusive of love and intuition, and the Marxist   view of him as building the political community upon the abstract   labouring will, this article argues for the ongoing importance of love   in Hegel's mature political philosophy. Furthermore, it suggests that   the need to protect and preserve the knowledge of love from the   eclipsing effects of a narrow instrumental reasoning was an essential   motive in the development of Hegel's mature philosophical system.

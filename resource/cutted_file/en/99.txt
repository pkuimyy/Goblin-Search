TI Did Lenin Refound Marxist Dialectics in 1914?
SO EUROPEAN LEGACY-TOWARD NEW PARADIGMS
AB During the twentieth century a number of competing accounts of Lenin's   theory and practice have sought to reclaim its true meaning from   ossification under Stalinism. One account popular today is the   Hegelian-Marxist interpretation of Lenin's Philosophical Notebooks   written in 1914 and 1915. According to thinkers such as Raya   Dunayevskaya and Kevin Anderson, Lenin's notebooks on Hegel's Science of   Logic represent a radical break from classical dialectical materialism.   For these Hegelian-Marxists, Lenin's acerbic remarks on Engels's and   Plekhanov's dialectics reveal him as the forerunner of Georg Lukacs and   Herbert Marcuse and represent a thoroughgoing reconceptualization of the   dialectics of revolution. In this article I submit these arguments to   the test of a fine grained textual analysis. I conclude, opposite to the   Hegelian-Marxist narrative, that Lenin neither intended to nor   accomplished a refoundation of Marxist dialectics in 1914. The notion of   quantity-quality leaps Lenin adds to his works from 1914 onwards show   him less as an innovator in Marxist philosophy and more as a keeper of   the flame of dialectical materialist orthodoxy.

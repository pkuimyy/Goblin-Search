TI Todorov, Levinas and anti-totalitarian humanism: A perspective on
SO HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
AB This article explores the significance of anti-totalitarian humanism for   contemporary moral and social philosophy, with special reference to the   thinking of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995). Special use is made of Tzvetan   Todorov's (1939) work "Hope and memory" to clarify the framework within   which anti-totalitarian humanism takes shape, and also to shed light. on   the relation, similarities and disagreements between the totalitarian   utopianism that characterized twentieth century fascist regimes, and   other versions and residues of the utopian tradition, such as we   encounter in Levinas and the early generation of Neo-Marxist   philosophers. Levinas' attempt in his early works to develop a humanism   that is founded in both everyday material existence and interpersonal   relationships is then examined in closer detail. Interpretations of the   utopian significance of his phenomenological notions such as death, time   and sociality, Messianic hope, despair and moral repair are offered. It   is emphasized that Levinas' early notion of innerworldly bliss   constitutes a utopian core in his thought that is to be separate from   the notion of innerworldly bliss that characterizes totalitarian   utopianism, and also undermines the philosophical foundations of   totalitarian utopianism.

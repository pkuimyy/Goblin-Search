TI Transcoding Kant: Kracauer's Weimar Marxism and After
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Kracauer's rehabilitation in the 1990s sidelined his Marxist framework   of the middle-to-late Weimar era in favour of the then still dominant if   decaying paradigms of poststructuralism and postmodernism. It was also   silent on the relationship between Kant and Marxism in Kracauer's work.   This essay addresses these weaknesses by arguing that Kracauer   transcoded the structure of Kant's 'problematic' around reification into   a Marxist framework in the middle-to-late Weimar period. The essay   considers how Kracauer conceived the mass ornament (photography and film   especially) as a site of reification and critical pedagogy. It explores   his strategies of de-reification and their overlap with Walter Benjamin   and the ruptures and continuities between the radical Weimar work and   his later Theory of Film. The essay argues that the Theory of Film can   be better understood as a transcoding of Kant's philosophy of the   aesthetic in the third Critique into the film camera itself, although   the Marxian framework of the Weimar period is now considerably   attenuated.

TI REFORMERS IN SEARCH OF A LANGUAGE: YEGOR GAIDAR'S STATE AND EVOLUTION
SO NOVOE LITERATURNOE OBOZRENIE
AB Timur Atnashev examines the intellectual legacy of Yegor Gaidar as a   philosopher of history and political philosopher, proceeding from his   book State and Evolution. Using the Cambridge approach, two basic   historiosophical languages are highlighted: a) a neo-Marxist and   simultaneously liberal language based on the central idioms of the   "Asiatic method of production" and the division between private property   and the state (i.e. "Eastern" and "Western" civilizations); b) the   perestroika-informed historiosophical language of "choosing a path" and   "historical alternatives". By combining these two languages, which   demonstrate different answers to the question of predetermination and   freedom in history, Gaidar offered a solution to the contradictory   rhetorical dilemmas of justifying his course of reform in the context of   the Soviet and Russian history.

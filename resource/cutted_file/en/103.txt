AU Semyonov, Yuri
TI HISTORY AS A REAL PROCESS: HISTORICAL SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY
SO EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
AB In this article author considers the problem of epistemology of   historical knowledge. Author doesn't accept the neo-kantianism theory.   He makes an attempt to differ the two forms of unitarization of   scientific knowledge - theoretization and the principle of holism and,   hence, the two forms of the theoretical consideration of history. The   author insists that the Marxists approach seems to be the most relevant   from this point of view. Thus, he defends the thesis that the idealistic   concepts are much vulnerable comparing with the materialistic   approaches.

TI How to revive the "frozen" evolutionary ontology
SO FILOSOFICKY CASOPIS
AB This discussion study takes as its starting point the thinking, which   Professor Smajs and others presented in Filosoficky casopis 6, 2013 on   evolutionary ontology. The author shows an enduring aspect of   evolutionary ontology: ontology as the product of human culture attains   to knowledge that has the seeming character of objective truth it thus   expresses the true nature of the ontic order of nature. This is not,   however, the usual nonsense of inconsistent philosophy. The author of   the text identifies as lying behind this step Kantian and Hegelian   strategies which make possible this shift from the order of culture to   the order of nature. These strategies are (i) a sign of the grounding of   Professor Smajs' ideas in early-modern thinking; and (ii) they are the   cause of a strongly anthropocentric attitude, which unwittingly   influences the system of evolutionary-ontology At the end of the study,   the author points to the fact that it would be more appropriate for   evolutionary ontology if its proponents were able to give up their   early-modern argumentative approach, and thus rid themselves of their   strong anthropocentrism. In this way they would be able to avoid the   conceptual conflict which makes evolutionary ontology "frozen" from   within.

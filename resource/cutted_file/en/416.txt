TI POSTMODERNISM, GEOGRAPHY, AND THE SOCIAL SEMIOTICS OF SPACE
SO ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING D-SOCIETY & SPACE
AB The nucleus of postmodern philosophy and theory is derived primarily   from French neostructuralist writings. The ontological foundation of   such literature is the idealist rejection of the possibility of knowing   reality and, as a consequence, the enclosure of the subject within the   signifying universe, which in turn results in the exaltation of the   signifying processes as the only social processes. The same emphasis,   but through nonverbal means, is demonstrated by postmodern architectural   and urban design. In geography, however, postmodernism is interpreted   differently. In two recent books (by Soja and by Harvey) the postmodern   era in human geography is related to the heightened importance of space   for social reality and theory. But the split of geography itself between   Marxist geography on the one hand, and behavioural and humanistic   geography on the other, shows the pertinence of the signifying dimension   for the field of geography. In this paper, it is argued that the roles   of space and meaning are equally important for geography, and it is   proposed that an analysis of the signifying aspect of space may be   achieved through semiotics, currently the most complete and   sophisticated theory of meaning and culture. The main problem for   geography, which is addressed in the final section of this paper, is the   integration of a renewed version of the semiotics of space with an   equally renewed Marxist geography, the most powerful explanatory   approach to geography we have at our disposal.

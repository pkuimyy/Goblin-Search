TI Plural Temporality: Transindividuality and the Aleatory between Spinoza
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB This review analyzes the six related essays that comprise Vittorio   Morfino's book Plural Temporality: Transindividuality and the Aleatory   between Spinoza and Althusser, each of which involve key points of   intervention and related philosophical debates regarding the references   to Spinoza that comprised Althusser's constant labor in Marxist theory.   Reconstructing some of the crucial arguments and their implications, I   show that Morfino synthesizes these elements scattered throughout   Althusser in a productive and rigorous historical recapitulation that   results in new insights for an ontology of relations and the theory of   temporality which must be constructed out of its demands. While the   points of departure often revolve around Athusserian philosophy,   Morfino's endeavor constitutes its own extensive intervention into the   current theoretical conjuncture, and stands up as an important   touchstone for contemporary work in Althusserian philosophy, Spinoza's   Marxism, and Marxist theory more broadly.

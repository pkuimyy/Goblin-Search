TI Marx's Philosophy of Revolution in Permanence: Its Significance for Our
SO TRIPLEC-COMMUNICATION CAPITALISM & CRITIQUE
AB How can Marx's ideas help us with the problem of how to make new   revolutionary beginnings in a time when the counterrevolution is   ascendant, without losing sight of the need to prepare for the equally   crucial question of what happens after the revolution? Capitalism has   taken various forms as it developed, with the latest shaped by its   endemic crisis since the mid-1970s generated by its falling rate of   profit. Throughout these stages, the humanism and dialectic of Capital   remain prime determinants of allowing Marxist responses not to stop at   economic analyses but to release, rather than inhibiting, new   revolutionary subjects and directions. Critical for the present moment   is to take up Marx's humanism and dialectic as crucial dimensions of his   philosophy of revolution in permanence. This encompasses not alone the   famous March 1850 Address to the Communist League, but also the full   trajectory of Marx's revolutionary life and thought from the 1844   Economic-Philosophic Manuscripts through Capital to the new moments of   Marx's last decade as expressed in his writings on Russia and his   Ethnological Notebooks. We trace Marx's theoretical/ philosophical   concept of permanent revolution in a number of his writings, to confront   how various post-Marx Marxists addressed or ignored this dimension of   Marx's thought, and explore whether this concept can be seen as central   to Marx's body of thought, and can assist in the dual task of needed   revolutionary transformation-the destruction of the old ( negation) and   the construction of the new ( the negation of the negation).

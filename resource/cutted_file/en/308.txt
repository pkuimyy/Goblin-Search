TI Personal way of being during SL Frank: interface between anthropology
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB This article strives to combine conceptions of the person by SemA << n   Frank. From his early critical Marxist works to his metaphysical   personalism and late Christian anthropology, he covered   normative-ethical, transcendent-epistemological, and 'total   unity'aEuro"ontological questions in equal measure. This diversity will   be synthesized in comparisons of his personalist and ontological   thought. The text will highlight Frank's different schemes of personal   modes of being, i.e. correlations between the 'I-thou' relationship and   the absolute being, and move on to contrast his concepts of ontological   personality.

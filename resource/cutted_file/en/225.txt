SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL THEORY
AB Theodor W. Adorno asked in 1968: What is the fundamental question of the   present structure of society? Do we live in late capitalism or an   industrial society? In today's society, we can reformulate this   question: What is the fundamental question of the present structure of   society? Do we live in capitalism or an information society? This   article deals with these questions. A typology of information society   theories is presented. Radical discontinuous information society   theories, sceptical views and continuous information society theories   are distinguished. Second, an alternative concept that is grounded in   Hegelian philosophy and Marxist political economy is presented. The   basic argument is that the emergence of transnational informational   capitalism is a transformational sublation, but not a radical one, and   that informational capitalism is just one of the forms of capitalism   that co-exist today. There is a unity of diversity of capitalism(s).

TI Wikipedia: An Info-Communist Manifesto
SO TELEVISION & NEW MEDIA
AB The task of this article is to analyze the political economy of   Wikipedia. We discuss the specifics of Wikipedia's mode of production.   The basic principles of what we call the info-communist mode of   production will be presented. Our analysis is grounded in Marxist   philosophy and Marxist political economy, and is connected to the   current discourse about the renewal and reloading of the idea of   communism that is undertaken by thinkers like Slavoj Ziek and Alain   Badiou. We explore to which extent Wikipedia encompasses principles that   go beyond the capitalist mode of production and represent the   info-communist mode of production. We present the subjective dimension   of the mode of production (cooperative labor), the objective dimension   of the mode of production (common ownership of the means of production),   and the subject-object dimension of the mode of production (the effects   and products of the mode of production).

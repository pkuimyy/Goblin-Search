TI Critique of revolutionary consciousness in the work of Semyon Frank
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
AB In this paper, the author traces down the evolution of social and   political ideas of the eminent Russian philosopher of the 20th century   Semyon Ludwigovich Frank (1877-1950). As a young man, Frank had been an   adherent of the Marxist variety of radical socialism; only the events of   1905-1907 led him, as well as other young intellectuals of his   generation, such as Berdyaev, Bulgakov, Struve, Isgoev, Kistyakovski and   others, to abandoning Marxism and positivism first for moderate   Christian liberalism and then eventually for liberal conservatism. The   immediate effect of the first Russian revolution on Frank was that he   became member of the Constitutional Democratic Party and took part in   1909 collection of essays Vekhi ('Landmarks'). The article, further on,   contains a detailed analysis of the most important among Frank's   writings in political philosophy, mainly intended to debunk the ideology   of Russian revolutionary intelligentsia, such as Philosophical   prerequisites of Despotism (1907), The Ethics of Nihilism (Frank's   contribution to Vekhi, 1909), De profundis (an essay from the homonymous   collection of 1918), and the emigrant publication Beyond the Left and   the Right (1930).

AU Berardi, Franco Bifo
TI ACCELERATIONISM QUESTIONED FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE BODY
SO LOGOS
AB The article starts out with a question: is acceleration, proposed as a   strategy by the accelerationist hypothesis, not only a necessary but   also a sufficient condition for the ultimate and unalterable destruction   of capitalist order? The author is quick to respond in the negative,   arguing that catastrophism per se is already written in this order-and   even constitutes the ground of its power. In turn, the deduction of the   accelerationist hypothesis from the works of Deleuze and Guattari (which   is commonly performed by both its champions and opponents) has its own   limitations. In "What is Philosophy?", Deleuze and Guattari move away   from the irrevocable value of acceleration (as a revolutionary   methodology) in favour of the determination of stability in the midst of   chaos. In that work, they emphasize the relation between chaos and the   brain, leading the author to suggest that the bodily point of view is   crucial, not only for a discussion of occasional ruptures in the works   of Deleuze and Guattari, but also for any discussion of the   "accelerating machine."   From the perspective of sensibility, chaos acts as the pathological   perception of speed. Acceleration itself becomes a function which leads   to the dysfunction of the whole system of the body-to a panic which   appears as an inversion of the paranoia of capitalist order. The author   notes that there is some conceptual proximity between the concept of   general intellect (from Marx of the "Grundrisse" era to Autonomist   Marxist Paolo Virno) and the accelerationist hypothesis. However, seeing   that the latter mistakes liberating potentiality (latent in the present   composition of work and technology) for almost logical necessity, he   perceives the proximity between them to be very dangerous.

SO SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
AB Although first published in 1941 Herbert Marcus' "Some Implications of   Modem Technology" (published in Studies in Philosophy and Social   Sciences) suggested that the modern machine age with its' efficiency   fetish has substituted for commodity fetish at the hands of an   authoritarian state. A typical Marxist ideology of the old left during   that period of time.   However, many of the implications located in postmodern technology   Marcus failed to see as a volunteristic behavior, mainly due to the time   span between the modem and postmodern age. Predominate among these   effects is the loss of individuality.   Today the impact of the computer age leads to standardization of   thought, social conformity, and should be seen as a volunteristic social   by-product of the nature of advanced technology, and not the tool of an   authoritarian state.

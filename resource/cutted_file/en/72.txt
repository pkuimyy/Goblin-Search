TI Rethinking Soviet Marxism: The Case of Evald Ilyenkov A Review of
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB This review-essay explores approaches to the thought of the creative   Soviet Marxist thinker Evald Ilyenkov as discussed in a recent book   edited by Alex Levant and Vesa Oittinen, Dialectics of the Ideal: Evald   Ilyenkov and Creative Soviet Marxism. The book consists of a series of   commentaries and contextual essays which centre on the translated text   of Ilyenkov's Dialectics of the Ideal. The approach the authors take to   Ilyenkov's work differs from previous ones of exploring the totality of   Ilyenkov's thought or eclectic aspects of it. By commenting on and   contextualising Ilyenkov's major text on the Ideal they locate the   contribution of Ilyenkov in dialogue with traditions of classical   European philosophy, and Western and Soviet Marxism, and in his   importance to contemporary issues in philosophy and other disciplines. A   deep analysis of Ilyenkov's dense and often complex text is also given.   By doing so the authors highlight the immense contribution of Ilyenkov   to contemporary thought.

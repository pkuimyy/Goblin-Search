TI Brecht and Lukacs as teachers of Feyerabend and Lakatos: the
SO HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB Feyerabend and Lakatos were invited to be assistants of the literary   Marxists Brecht and Lukacs, respectively. In the 1930s Expressionism   Debate, Lukacs associated artistic expressionism with irrationalism and   fascism, while Brecht criticized Lukacs' anti-modernism. Lakatos'   criticisms of Kuhn echo Lukacs' denunciations of German idealism, and   Lukacs influenced the terminology and topics in Lakatos' methodology.   Lakatos, concerned with progress, and fearful of irrationalism and   degeneration, recapitulates positions of his teacher, Lukacs, in the   latter's attack on modern art. Feyerabend's criticisms of Lakatos   parallel Brecht's critique of Lukacs.

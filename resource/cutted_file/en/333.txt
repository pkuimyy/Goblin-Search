TI PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS IN THE EPOCH OF REBIRTH
SO PROBLEMOS
AB After examining shortly some general issues concerning relation of   philosophy to politics, the author of the article makes an attempt to   answer the question why during the period of Lithuania's political   rebirth, in the years 1988-1993, Lithuanian philosophers representing a   discipline which in its Marxist form had been regarded as an ideological   basis of the Soviet rule took a vigorous part in political activities   aiming at liberation from that rule. With this aim in mind, analysis of   the situation of philosophy in occupied Lithuania is presented. A   special emphasis is put on the situation at Vilnius University. An   attempt is being made to explain why and in which respect it was   different from that at other universities in the Soviet Union. The   factors that were responsible for a relatively high reputation of   philosophers among Lithuanian reading public are examined. Exactly that   high reputation and the developed sense of responsibility explains why   philosophers were so eager to join the popular movement aiming at the   liberation of Lithuania, were able to become its distinguished leaders   and play a very important role in the political rebirth and the   consolidation of the regained independence. Some issues related to the   periodization of the development of Lithuanian philosophy during the   last six decades are also put under scrutiny.

TI 'DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM AND MODERN PHYSICS', AN UNPUBLISHED TEXT BY MAX
SO NOTES AND RECORDS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY
AB A previously unpublished manuscript by the physicist Max Born, one of   the creators of quantum mechanics, is presented. The manuscript was   addressed to Born's colleague Leon Rosenfeld and criticized his attempt   to show that Niels Bohr's doctrine of complementarity was an example of   dialectical materialism and as such in perfect agreement with Marxist   philosophy. Besides illustrating the deep political divisions among   defenders of the 'Copenhagen spirit' in quantum physics, the manuscript   is also a valuable source illuminating Max Born's philosophical position   about scientific methodology and epistemology.

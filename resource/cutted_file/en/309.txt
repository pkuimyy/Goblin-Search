TI Quentin Skinner's revised historical contextualism: a critique
SO HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB Since the late 1960s Quentin Skinner has defended a highly influential   form of linguistic contextualism for the history of ideas, originally   devised in opposition to established methodological orthodoxies like the   'great text' tradition and a mainly Marxist epiphenomenalism. In 2002,   he published Regarding Method, a collection of his revised   methodological essays that provides a uniquely systematic expression of   his contextualist philosophy of history. Skinner's most arresting   theoretical contention in that work remains his well-known claim that   past works of political theory cannot be read as contributions to   'perennial' debates but must instead be understood as particularistic,   ideological speech acts. In this article I argue that he fails to   justify these claims and that there is actually nothing wrong at all   with (where appropriate) treating past works of political theory as   engaged in perennial philosophical debates. Not only do Skinner's   arguments not support the form of contextualism he defends, their flaws   are actually akin to those he identified in his critique of previous   methodological orthodoxies.

TI TWO PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES ON CREOLE LANGUAGES
SO REVUE ROUMAINE DE PHILOSOPHIE
AB In this article I discuss the philosophical grounds of two different   ways to analyse the Creole languages. The first is rooted in the   Cartesian linguistics and it is represented by the works of Michel   DeGraff and Noam Chomsky. The second is elaborated within the works of   Edouard Glissant and it fits into the scheme of the Marxist philosophy   of language systematised by Valentin Volosinov. Far from separating   these two perspectives on the Creole languages, our main scope is to   make possible a philosophical dialogue between them.

SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Pierre Macherey's Hegel or Spinoza? suggests that Hegel was driven to   his now legendary misinterpretations of Spinoza because he could not   accept Spinozism without compromising his own philosophy. Macherey shows   us a Spinoza that pre-emptively resists and challenges Hegel's   understanding of Spirit as Subject realising itself through   self-negation and contradiction. This review draws out the central   arguments in the book, and those arguments most salient for contemporary   theories of capitalism and revolution, and points towards possible   implications for Marxist theory.

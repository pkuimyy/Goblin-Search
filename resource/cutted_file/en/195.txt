TI Doubt, conflict, mediation: the anthropology of modern time
SO JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
AB In this introduction, I argue that in spite of recent discussions of   global and neoliberal time, the anthropology of modern time remains   under-explored. Modern time here is understood to be a complex   historical product. At its centre is the abstract time-reckoning of   capitalism, which acts as a universal measure of value, but which always   comes into conflict with concrete experiences of time. Its social   disciplines emerge from Christian practice, but the ethics of these   routines are marked as secular and universal. Its politics is founded on   representations of the natural connections of communities through a   homogeneous historical time. Its science and technology tightly link   social, human time to external non-human rhythms. It is important for   anthropologists to reflect on modern time because our discipline has   been profoundly influenced by the discoveries of its depth, secularity,   and relativity. The controversies that emerged in relation to Darwin's   and Einstein's insights still provide the framework for many of our   theories, especially when we draw on phenomenological philosophy. In   this introduction, I suggest that the key resources for overcoming this   significant absence in anthropology lie in a rapprochement between   Alfred Gell's epistemology of time and the approaches of Marxist   political philosophers. This combination, along with an emphasis on the   labour in/of time, gives rise to new questions and reveals new aspects   of modern time in the present.

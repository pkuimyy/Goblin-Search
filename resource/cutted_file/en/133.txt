TI Jose Mariategui's East-South Decolonial Experiment
SO COMPARATIVE AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY
AB Common notions of comparative philosophy tend to be strongly configured   by the East-West axis. This essay suggests ways of seeing Latin American   liberation philosophy as a form of comparative philosophy and an   important Latin American thinker as being relevant for East-West   political philosophy. The essay focuses on the Peruvian activist and   intellectual, Jose Mariategui, who is widely regarded to have been a   leading Marxist, liberatory, and decolonial figure in 20th century Latin   America. Like many "Third World" intellectuals of the interwar years,   Mariategui had an interest in decolonization struggles in Asia and wrote   with some consistency on this subject and in ways that bear   significantly upon key themes in his political theory. Since very little   of this has received commentary, this essay begins a discussion of   Mariategui's decolonial experimentation with ideas about Asia,   decolonization, and indigenous cultural forms, like those of the Incas   and Confucians. After some preliminary discussion of Eurocentrism,   postcolonial thought, and decolonial thought, attention is focused on   Mariategui's East-South geography of liberation, heuristic use of   Chinese revolutionary politics, and Sinified hermeneutic for   conceptualizing the consciousness of the Peruvian indigenous, a central   element of his political theory.

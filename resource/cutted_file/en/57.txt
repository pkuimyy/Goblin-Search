TI Shining Path's Literary System: The Barbarians Within Us
SO INTERVENTIONS-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POSTCOLONIAL STUDIES
AB In the midst of the 1960s alphabet soup of Marxist revolutionaries, an   offshoot of Peru's Communist Party founded Shining Path. The rebel   commander, philosophy professor Abimael Guzman, merged the pioneering   work of Indo-American socialist Jose Carlos Mariategui (1894-1930) with   dogmatic readings of Marx, Lenin and Mao. On 20-27 March 1980, party   leaders read William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Macbeth, a   selection of Mao Zedong's early poetry, the memoirs of Peru's field   marshal Andres A. Caceres, Washington Irving's The Life of Mahomet,   Joseph Stalin's 3 July 1941 radio address, and Aeschylus' Prometheus   Bound. This essay argues these literary readings prepared the party to   conduct war by identifying the enemy within, establishing an   esprit-de-corps, and enshrining Guzman as undisputed leader. The timing   of the literary sessions coincides with the initiation of a guerrilla   war that claimed 69,000 lives and billions of dollars in damage. The   principles that nourished Shining Path's authoritarianism persist today,   albeit in mutated form, as political dogmatism emerges to battle   reformist policies that deviate from the perceived interests of a   radicalized base. The review of Shining Path's literary system aims to   prevent us from unwisely claiming contemporary postcolonial religious,   secular or national fundamentalisms within our communities as senseless,   savage or irrational anachronisms.

TI Constructing Philosophy of Environmental Education in Contemporary
SO WORLDWIDE TRENDS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATION AND ACADEMIC RESEARCH
AB The content of environmental education at any level of an educational   system seems to be evident and universal because of the gravity of   contemporary environmental challenges. However obvious differentiation   of environmental knowledge is an unresolved issue both in educational   practice and in philosophy of environmental education. The environmental   education on the whole and ecology as a course at school or university   are determined by technological, social, political, legal and cultural   factors. Besides, environmental education and its philosophical   foundation depend on actual peculiarities of a country development. The   factors influencing philosophical reasoning about environmental   education in contemporary Russia and revealed in the paper are the   following: the reactualization of non-Marxist traditions in Russian   philosophy, educational tradition of knowledge paradigm, socially   inactiveness of Russians, depending on state decisions, bureaucratic   organization of science branches.

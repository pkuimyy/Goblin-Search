TI "The Look of the Other" - Constellations of Power:
SO GRUPPENPSYCHOTHERAPIE UND GRUPPENDYNAMIK
AB The fundamental structure of a (therapeutic) group is not solely   constituted by way of questioning the phenomena of power and   powerlessness. The way in which this question is framed is itself   representative of given constellations of power and the affective   dispositions as these prevail in society as a whole. J.-P. Sartre   undertook a detailed study of such phenomena along with an analysis of   their subsequent Marxist revision in the concluding sections of his work   on existential philosophy - an endeavour which warrants further   philosophical and group-analytical review. Indeed, somewhat   surprisingly, it was by way of Foulkes approach to group analysis that   Sartre's analysis achieved compatible and affine results.

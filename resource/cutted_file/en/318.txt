TI Reminiscences on the Origins of Journal Sociologia
SO SOCIOLOGIA
AB Fortieth anniversaries of renaissance of the Slovak sociology that was   destroyed by the commencing communist regime in the 1949 fall in the   first decade of the third millennium. This period was marked by the   birth of the Slovak Sociological Society (1964), Department of Sociology   at the Faculty Arts, Comenius University in Bratislava (1964), Institute   for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS) (1965) and of a   journal of the Institute for Sociology of SAS - Sociologia in 1969.   Before, sociological studies and research had been published in the   journal Otazky marxistickej filozofie (Issues of Marxist Philosophy).   The founding of journal Sociologia was aided by foreign sociologists   such as Jan Szczepanski (then the president of International   Sociological Association) and Ernest Gellner from London School of   Economics. Membership in the editorial board was offered to sociologists   from A. Stefanek's (founder of the Slovak sociology) generation, to his   students and to a generation that graduated from the renewed Department   of Sociology at the Faculty of Arts, Comenius University in Bratislava.   Such intergenerational grouping of sociologists succeeded in developing   a concept of a Slovak scientific periodical of a very high quality, even   though it only lasted from 1969 to 1970. Coming era of normalization of   the communist regime in the Czechoslovakia brought about radical changes   in the concept pushed through by representatives of the scientific   communism.

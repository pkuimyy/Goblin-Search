SO ANDAMIOS
AB The author proposes a reading of Marxism that rescues the creative   potential of the materialist conception of history tied to the   emancipatory dimension of Marxist socialism. The recovery of this notion   implies distancing Marxism from historic productivist/progressive   philosophies without failing to recognize its debt to positivism, but   highlighting a richer and more multidimensional vision of history.

TI Beyond the Cold War? Arendt's Reception in Germany and Italy
SO SOCIOLOGICA-ITALIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY ON LINE
AB The reception of Arendt's thought in Germany and in Italy presents at   first glance a similar trend. From the second postwar until 1968 Arendt   is chiefly known for her works on totalitarianism and received by   liberal thinkers. During the student protests with the rise of marxist   theories her notoriety sinks, especially in the social sciences. The end   of the cold war and the following crisis of orthodox marxism mark a new   positive trend of her reception as a consequence of the need of left   intellectuals to search new symbolic sources to re-legitimate   themselves. However, beyond this shared master narrative the reception   of Arendt's in the singular SSH disciplinary fields of the two countries   presents many differences as different are their social and symbolic   spaces and boundaries and their position in the respective national   hierarchy of academic disciplines. Aim of the paper is then to analyze   Arendt's reception within some pivotal disciplines (i.e. political   science, political philosophy) in light of their cultural and   institutional history and of the influence of their respective national   political cultural context, in particular for what regards their public   memory.

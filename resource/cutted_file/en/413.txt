TI TEACHING HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY - NOTES ON REPRESENTING MARXISM
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB ThiS paper offers a critique of recent representations of 'Marxist   geography'. The argument is geared towards those teaching undergraduate   courses dealing with the history, philosophy and theory of paradigms   within geography. Focusing on three recent student textbooks which offer   'official' accounts of the nature of contemporary geography geared to   such courses and on keynote academic commentaries, I point to four   persistent problems in the representation of 'Marxist geography' and   suggest a template through which teachers can offer students a more   discriminating and faithful account of that paradigm.

AU WHITE, OF
TI DEMING TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT MOVEMENT AND THE BASKIN-ROBBINS PROBLEM
SO ADMINISTRATION & SOCIETY
AB W. Edwards Deming's philosophy of total quality management (TQM)   constitutes more than an approach to management. It is also a   full-fledged theory of organization and a theory of society and politics   that holds important implications for relations between nation-states in   the emerging ''new world order.'' When examined in this light, it   appears that TQM is not collectivist or Marxist in the way that it is   sometimes understood, but that it does stand in tension with a number of   aspects of the traditional liberal American political and social   tradition At the same time, however, it is quite consistent with the   revolutionary, antifederalist subtheme that has persisted throughout   U.S. history.

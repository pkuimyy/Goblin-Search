AU SAYAN, E
TI IS MARXIST PHILOSOPHY WITHERING AWAY
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB Gorbachev's ascent to power in the Soviet Union in 1985 and the events   that followed appear to have led to a dramatic decline in philosophers'   interest in Marxist philosophy. The magnitudes of philosophical   literature on Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Hegel recorded in annual volumes   of The Philosopher's Index have all been shrinking in recent years. In   the 1992 volume, the share of the publications on Marx within all   philosophical publications has dropped to almost one-third of what it   was on average in the 1981-1985 volumes, on Engels and Lenin to about   one-fifth, and on Hegel to about two-thirds.

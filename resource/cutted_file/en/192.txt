TI Hobbes, Locke and the Consequences: Shaftesbury's Moral Sense and
SO JOURNAL FOR EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES
AB This article examines the political (and Whig) agenda behind the earl of   Shaftesbury's moral and religious thought, offering a reading of the   so-called moral sense' that, based on Terry Eagleton's Marxist   interpretation of moral-sense philosophy in general and Shaftesbury's   use of the concept in particular, illuminates how far the moral sense   serves a propagandistic purpose in Shaftesbury's writings. A close   examination of this aspect, which has so far not been considered in the   relevant literature on Shaftesbury, illuminates the anti-Hobbist and, by   implication, anti-Tory (and High Church) tendency of his moral   philosophy in the context of Low Church Anglicanism.

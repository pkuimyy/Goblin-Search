TI JACQUES RANCIERE: ART, POLITICS AND PEDAGOGY PHILOSOPHY OF AN
SO BOLETIN DE ARTE
AB This article attempts to provide an introduction to the philosophical   view of Jacques Ranciere around issues linking art practice, art theory   and the political problem of emancipation. Through its considerations   about the historical relationship between classical education and the   development of critical Marxist theory, we approach its proposal to   overcome the reproductive logic of inequality given and his rediscovery   of the emancipatory potential hiding in the aesthetic experience, as   often assumed to be disinterested, apolitical and useless.

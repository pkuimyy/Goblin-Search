TI The German Turners and the Taming of Radicalism in Chicago [1]
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT
AB The German Turner movement, a nationalistic gymnastic enterprise,   migrated to the United States in the aftermath of the failed revolution   of 1848. It quickly took hold in American cities with sizable German   populations. Many German Turners espoused liberal philosophies,   including Marxist, socialist and anarchist sympathies in their political   views. They assumed leadership roles in politics, education and the   labour movement; but those radical sympathies dissipated over time in   the United States. This case study of Chicago, the centre of the   American labour movement and a bastion of Turnerism in the United   States, examines and analyzes the transition of Turner ideology and   practice, from initial radicalism to incorporation within the mainstream   political system, and from a focus on gymnastics to adoption of American   sport forms. That transition occurred rather rapidly, largely over a   period of two generations, by which time American Turners admitted that   they had little in common with their European brethren. The article   offers insights into the complex nature of sport, ideology and practice   within the process of cultural flow.

TI Universalism in cultural history and the meaning of the Russian
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB Mikhail Lific (1905-1983) is one of the most contradictory and to this   date poorly understood authors of the Soviet era. He represented an   independent Marxist position, but one internally characterized by the   tense relationship between Marxism and the philosophy of Hegel. This   relationship, concerning historical philosophical questions, is the   subject of this essay. In the 1930s, as "historical materialism" was   canonized in the USSR, a development that Soviet civilization understood   as the "beginning of the end of (universal) history", Lific drafted a   different, skeptical summary of the revolutionary era. However, he   remained loyal to both the concept of universal history and the   examination of Russian-Soviet cultural history within the framework of   this concept. With the help of a text from Lific from the 1930s as well   as his later (early 1980s) reflection and remembrance of the ideological   debates of the 1930s, this essay will show that Lific' reconstruction of   idealism in Marxism was no accident, but rather a necessary movement in   thought. This, in turn, enabled him to give a new account of the   historical experience of the October Revolution.

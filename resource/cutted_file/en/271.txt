SO CURRICULUM INQUIRY
AB This conceptual essay explores how Gerald Vizenor's (Anishinaabe)   literary discussions of "shadow survivance" provide opportunities to   work against the containment of Indigenous knowledge in mainstream and   culture-based curricular practices. More specifically, the essay   considers how constructivism is deployed as an opening to the inclusion   of Indigenous epistemologies, yet also contains Indigenous   epistemologies within a materialist and more specifically, Marxist and   Hegelian philosophy. The author suggests that an implicit "shadow   curriculum" has been articulated within the literature of Native   culture-based curriculum which works against these forms of containment,   but has rarely turned to Native American literary figures to elaborate   the philosophical and theoretical differences they represent.

AB Alain Badiou's elaboration of a subject faithful to an event is commonly   known today in the academic world and beyond. However, his first   systematic account of the subject (Theorie du Sujet) was already   published in 1982 and did not mention the 'event' at all. Therefore,   this article aims at tracing back both the structural and the historical   conditions that directed Badiou's elaboration of the subject in the   early work up until the publication of L'Etre et l'Evenement in 1988. On   the one hand, it investigates to what extent the (early) Badiouan   subject can be considered an exceptional product of the formalist   project of the Cahiers pour l'Analyse as instigated by psychoanalytical   discourse (Lacan) and a certain Marxist discourse (Althusser) insofar as   both were centered upon a theory of the subject. On the other hand, this   article examines the radical political implications of this subject   insofar as Badiou has directed his philosophical aims towards the   political field as a direct consequence of the events of May'68.

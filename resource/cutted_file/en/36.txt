TI Is Ralph Miliband's Political Philosophy currently valid? Some proposals
SO DAIMON-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE FILOSOFIA
AB Ralph Miliband was a leading contributor to the development of Marxist   theory of the state in the late twentieth century, particularly on the   labour party, state, class analysis and political participation. I   analyse if his writings remain influential in twenty-first century. I   trace briefly the development of Miliband's sociological thought and   identifies three key themes and debates. I examine and evaluate the   central themes in Miliband's work: the crisis of labourism, the state in   the capitalist society and democratic socialism. The paper finishes with   a critical reflection on Miliband's legacy.

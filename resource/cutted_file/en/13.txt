TI DECOLONISING MARXISM. SOME CRITICAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING A SCHOOL OF
SO THEMATA-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
AB In this paper, we will attempt to outline a critique of the Marxist   tradition, with the aim of showing some of its more crudely Eurocentric   theoretical elements. From a decolonial perspective, we will observe   that a large part of this tradition continued to use ways of thinking,   conceptions and presuppositions that rendered it unfit in order to   understand the specific nature of the historical situation of the   colonised peoples. Moreover, in many cases the Marxist philosophy of   history led to an explicit justification of colonial violence, viewed as   a painful but necessary evil in order to give rise to a subsequent   transition to socialism. Eurocentric Marxism, therefore, could scarcely   assess in its intimate specificity the true nature of some anti-colonial   struggles.

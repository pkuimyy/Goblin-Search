TI Los heraldos negros by Cesar Vallejo or awareness tragic of the life
SO ALPHA-REVISTA DE ARTES LETRAS Y FILOSOFIA
AB We analyze the collection of poems titled Los heraldos negros by Cesar   Vallejo, with the object of determining the fundamental isotopies which   articulate the vision of the world expressed in these poems. From the   isotopy we have named "tragic conscience", the poetic text generates   three new thematic isotopies (God, childhood, woman) which appear as a   response to the absurd perception of life. For this analysis we use   contextual references taken from the author's biography and the historic   period in which Vallejo lived, particularly the references of   Existential philosophy and Marxist philosophy. We also base this   analysis on the notions of man-Adam and man-Christ as expressions of the   personal vision which is manifested in Vallejo's poetic idiolect.

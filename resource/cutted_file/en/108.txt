TI The Anthropocene: Thinking in "Deep Geological Time" or Deep Libidinal
SO INTERNATIONAL CRITICAL THOUGHT
AB This essay offers a socialist feminist postcolonial interpretation of   the Anthropocene concept as used in recent ecocriticism. In contesting   the rigid positioning of Humanity over Nature, the paper draws on the   Marxist psychoanalytic theory of non-identity in Theodor Adorno (1973)   and Julia Kristeva (1973, 1977, 1978). Making an ecofeminist   contribution to the new field of environmental humanities, it engages   critically with the perspective of prominent US scholar Timothy Morton   (2012). Its embodied materialist argument is that contemporary   Eurocentric institutions, science, and philosophies are indeed shaped by   affect as Morton believes, but not in the way that he envisages. In   addition, it is suggested that the socialist feminist postcolonial   politics of ecofeminism is already challenging the inevitable   universality of the Anthropocene by building an Earth Democracy with   epistemologies of care. It is concluded that understanding the   Anthropocene notion, a phenomenon that is profoundly gendered, requires   more than thinking in "deep geological time." Ultimately, all ecological   awareness will demand a capacity for thinking in "deep libidinal time."

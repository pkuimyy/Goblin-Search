TI A Russian Version of Christian Realism: Spiritual Wisdom and Politics in
SO INTERNATIONAL HISTORY REVIEW
AB Christian realism is a concept normally associated with the US   theologian and ethicist Reinhold Niebuhr. However, Niebuhr was not alone   in warning Christians of the dangers of utopianism and trying to promote   a religiously inspired political realism; thinkers from a number of   countries had similar aspirations. In this context, the Russian   philosopher Semyon Liudvigovich Frank (1877-1950) deserves particular   attention. A Marxist in his youth, Frank became disillusioned with   revolutionary ideas before and after the 1905 revolution, and was drawn   away from politics to philosophy. However, he remained interested in   political questions, both while he was in Russia and after he was forced   into exile in 1922. This found expression in the 1940s in a form of   Christian realism. Frank rejected the doctrine the end justifies the   means.' But he was a gradualist in his approach to social change,   believing that politicians needed to have a pragmatic attitude of mind.   A distinctive feature of Frank's approach was the connection he made   between spiritual inwardness on the one hand and effective   decision-making on the other, although he also saw spirituality as   arising in a social context. Ultimately, there was a mystical dimension   to Frank's Christian realism that was absent in Niebuhr's doctrine.

TI Karl Polanyi in Vienna Guild Socialism, Austro-Marxism and Duczynska's
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB In this article I discuss Polanyi's intellectual formation in early   twentieth-century Budapest and in 19205 Vienna, focusing in particular   upon his relationship to Guild Socialist and Marxist theory and to   Austrian Social Democracy. It was a period in which Marxism was evolving   rapidly, and Polanyi was too. In his twenties, he reacted forcefully   against what he saw as the evolutionary and deterministic traits of   Marxist philosophy. In his thirties, his relationship to Marxism   underwent a 'double movement': his long-held doubts about Marxism   crystallised into an forceful critique, swiftly followed by a   sympathetic dialogue with the ideas and politics of Austro-Marxism, the   'Rousseauian' commitments of which were not unlike his own. I examine   Polanyi's relationship with Marxism in each of these phases, and explore   the affinities between Guild Socialism and Austro-Marxism. The final   section introduces the distinctly un-Polanyian analysis of Austrian   Social Democracy offered by Polanyi's wife, Ilona Duczynska.

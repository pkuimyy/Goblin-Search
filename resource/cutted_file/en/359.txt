TI The future of critical philosophy and world politics
SO MILLENNIUM-JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES
AB This paper considers the legacy of Derrida's thought in the context of   the future challenge of contemporary politics: the construction of world   polity. It rehearses, first, the steps of the recent 'reconciliation'   between Jurgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida, and suggests, from out of   the terms of this reconciliation, that the deconstruction of reason has   been caught out by the contemporary movements of irrationalism. It then   deepens this historical viewpoint by giving a neo-Marxist account of   modem history in economic and political terms and by setting up from out   of this history the continuing problematic of modernity above and beyond   recent distinctions between the modern and the postmodern. The third   section of the paper returns to Derrida's late work on world democracy,   underlines its critical rigour with regard to modernity, the dilemma of   law and world sovereignty, and shows how this rigor can be considered to   address critically our future political challenge. The fourth section   then contends that the way in which Derridean thought disposes itself to   the real but nevertheless occludes concerted development of our   historical actuality and, in this sense, falls short of the critical. I   conclude, accordingly, by arguing for a renewed engagement between   critical philosophy and social science, with a focus on the promotion of   international institutions and strong interdisciplinary work between   international relations, international economics, and political   philosophy.

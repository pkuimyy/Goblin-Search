TI Zen Communist: Breyten Breytenbach's view from underground
SO TYDSKRIF VIR LETTERKUNDE
AB In an interview after his release from prison, Breyten Breytenbach   describes himself, at the time he became involved in underground   politics, as a Zen Communist. He returns occasionally to this   interaction of Marxist ideas of social revolution and Buddhist ideas of   non-attachment, but never attempts to explain the resulting synthesis   systematically. Indeed, for Breytenbach, being a Zen Communist is to   resist systematic positions, to accept contradiction as a constant   source of surprise and invention disruptive of all systematic thought.   This paper examines how this interaction of Marxist and Buddhist ideas   and practices has informed Breytenbach's politics in three contexts: his   initial exploration of a radical philosophy of history in his poetry   ("Bruin reisbrief", "Brown travel letter"); his role in the underground   politics of Okhelo in the 1970s, his reflections on politics and social   change in his prison and prison-related writings.

TI Causa sui or Wechselwirkung: Engels between Spinoza and Hegel
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB The essay takes its point of departure from Monod's reading of   dialectical materialism in Chance and Necessity. A passage of Engels's   Dialectics of Nature, which identifies Spinoza's concept of causa sui   with the Hegelian concept of interaction [Wechselwirkung], provides the   opportunity to examine the consequences of Monod's claims more closely.   Using Spinoza's philosophy as a litmus test, the essay attempts to   demonstrate the debt of Engels's materialism to Hegel's Science of Logic   by tracing the development of the concept of Wechselwirkung in classical   German philosophy. A profound difference between the Spinozan and   Hegelian concepts becomes apparent: while the concept of Wechselwirkung   implies a totality present to itself as simultaneity, permitting the   flow of a linear, homogenous and empty time upon which stages of   development can be inscribed, the concept of causa sui implies a   totality without closure, a totality whose eternity is identified with   the necessary and infinite network of modal durations. The essay   concludes by suggesting that Spinoza's concept of causa sui allows us to   rethink the relation between freedom and necessity in the Marxist   tradition in conjunctural and aleatory terms.

AB This article defends the claim that the philosophical aspect has been   seriously underrated in the scheme of the conceptualization of   contextual societal forces shaping education systems. The rise of   neo-Marxist paradigms since the 1970s has resulted in a disproportionate   emphasis on social and economic systems as factors shaping national   education systems. However, empirical research has recently rendered   evidence regarding how philosophical frameworks shape children's way of   viewing the world and how they think. This article provides examples of   this. Such philosophical and/or conceptual differences need to be   factored in the design and planning of education systems. Some   implications have been outlined regarding an expanded view of the role   of philosophy and/or life-concept for the planning and development of   education systems and for comparative education as afield of scholarly   research.

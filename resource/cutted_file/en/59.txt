TI EMMANUEL LEVINAS IN THE FACE OF THE RISE OF NAZISM ELEMENTARY
SO TOPICOS-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
AB In Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism (1934) and in the face of   the rise of Nazism in Europe, Levinas calls the European civilization,   in particular, the Jewish, Christian, Liberal and Marxist traditions, to   confront the emergence of the elementary philosophy of Hitlerism. In   this short article, the philosopher urges those traditions to trace   their identities back to their sources, intuitions and original   decisions, in particular, to the "spirit of freedom" that animates them   and to their conceptions of human destiny (Levinas, 1990: 64). However,   in contemporary reception on Levinas' reflections there's a   methodological and political discussion about how to interpret this   appeal to a common "spirit" or "feeling" shared by European traditions,   as well as about the meaning that acquires the elementary and   threatening counterpart that is Hitlerism. This paper aims to inquire   into some aspects of this methodological and political debate aroused by   interwar writings of Levinas.

TI Boris Hessen's ideas and Russian philosophy
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
AB In the present article, the main theses of Boris Hessen's 1931 paper are   brought under examination against the broader background of Russian   philosophy in general and the philosophy and history of science in   particular. Among other things, the author attempts to explain why   Hessen's Marxist thinking met with little or no acceptance in the   country of triumphant Marxism. In the Soviet Union, history and   philosophy of science developed mainly within an internalist framework,   first following mainly the positivist paradigm and later, from 1970s and   1980s, gravitating toward the post-positivist approaches of Thomas Kuhn   and Alexandre Koyre. Most of these studies, however, considered   technological and socioeconomic factors to be of little relevance to the   genesis of science. As a result, Hessen's ideas could find their place   neither within the positivist nor within the post-positivist explanatory   models used in Russian historical and philosophical studies of science.   This only started to change at the beginning of the 1990s, in the   post-Soviet era. Gradually, in a new intellectual climate, interest in   Hessen's ideas began to grow. A compound answer to the problem posed at   the beginning of the article is then outlined, taking as the starting   point the holistic interpretation of Hessen's paper offered by Gideon   Freudenthal and Peter McLaughlin.

TI Lenin and Philosophy: The Historical Context
SO EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES
AB The article follows the development of Lenin's philosophical conceptions   and the historical context in which they emerged. It examines how   Plekhanov's interpretation of Marxist philosophy was assimilated by   Lenin. In the dispute between Plekhanov and Alexander Bogdanov Lenin   took Plekhanov's side and in defence of Plekhanov wrote Materialism and   Empiriocriticism. A major influence on Lenin was the correspondence   between Marx and Engels published in 1913, which prompted him to study   Hegel and other writers mentioned in the correspondence. Although   Lenin's commentaries on Hegel and other philosophers were published as   'Philosophical Notebooks', the notes Lenin made on the Marx-Engels   correspondence were not, owing to Stalin's peculiar requirements of the   Lenin cult.

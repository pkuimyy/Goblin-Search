TI Simone Weil: Marxism beyond oneself
SO ETUDES PHILOSOPHIQUES
AB S. Weil's relationship to Marxism is paradoxical because it unveils a   loyalty to Marx in spite of ruptures and renunciations of the Marxist   theory. S. Weil's ties to Marxism seem discontinuous because after   having adopted certain revolutionary ideas during her first years of   political activism she criticizes Marx in the 30's and ends up seemingly   abandoning him in the last part of her fife. This path, however, far   from revealing the slow and inexorable disappearance of Marx's concepts,   rather, demonstrates the persistence and metamorphoses in S. Weil's   philosophy. We suggest then, that a criticism of the revolution followed   by a kind of Christianity developed in the wake of a year spent in the   factory, constitute S. Weil's own special manner of being Marxist, even   though Marxism seems to have become useless to her.

TI Towards a Theory of the Integral State
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB This review assesses the strengths and weaknesses of Peter Thomas's   long-awaited study of The Prison Notebooks, based on his extensive   research and philological reconstruction of the critical edition. I   distinguish three senses in which the 'moment' in the book's title can   be understood: as the historical moment around 1932 in which Gramsci   proposed the outline of his distinct brand of the philosophy of praxis;   as the moment or momentum that still lies in wait for a future research   programme in Marxist philosophy; and as a methodological principle for   understanding the dialectic as a theory in which entities such as state   and civil society but also coercion and consent, far from allowing the   kind of Eurocommunist or post-Marxist instrumentalisations in which they   are seen as part of a chain of binaries, are actually moments of a   unified larger structure that in Gramsci's work comes to be associated   with the idea of the integral state. This impressive reconstruction of   Gramsci's notebooks, however, also reveals some major lacunae, above   all, in terms of the lack of attention given to Gramscian developments   in the non-European world, in places such as India or Latin America.   This omission is all the more surprising given the longstanding   tradition, particularly in Latin America, of viewing Gramsci as a   theorist of the integral state more so than of hegemony.

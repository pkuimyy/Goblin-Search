TI Jacques Ranciere and Time: le temps d'apres
SO PARAGRAPH
AB This article asks whether the work of Jacques Ranciere might be said to   present a philosophy of time. Outlining the ways in which a   consideration of time is a central component of Ranciere's thinking on a   range of issues, particularly in his attention to the politics of time   (the time of workers, the invocation of different notions of past and   future in a range of political contexts), the article shows Ranciere's   resistance both to certain Marxist and to phenomenological notions of   time. Particular emphasis is given to the ways in which close attention   to Ranciere's writing as writing is essential to understanding some of   his key arguments.

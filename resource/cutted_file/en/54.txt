TI Philosophy as a critique of ideologies
SO FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
AB This article seeks to explain a specific interpretation of the relation   between philosophy and ideology which emerged in the period of 'Moscow   philosophical thaw' and gained considerable popularity with the   Sixtiers. The author centres his attention on two neo-Marxist theories,   the theory of thinking as developed by Evald Ilyenkov and the theory of   consciousness expounded by Merab Mamardashvili. It can be shown that   both theories have much in common: they both use the term 'ideology'   only as a pejorative; they share a similar understanding of 'the ideal'   (Ilyenkov) and 'the form' (Mamardashvili); they give equally deep   consideration to the problem of illusions, objective appearances,   'objective forms of thinking' and 'converted forms'. Not only do   Ilyenkov and Mamardashvili engage in a complex reciprocal interaction,   they also interact with Kant as author of the essay on What is   Enlightenment? An analysis of this 'timeless co-authorship' demonstrates   that no struggle for the liberation of humankind from the power of   ideologies can be successful unless a) a radical reform of education has   been accomplished, b) philosophical education is promoted in a form that   is free from the drawbacks and limitations of traditional enlightenment.

TI Overcoming Aesthetics in Zagreb School of Praxis Philosophy
SO FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB The aim of this paper is to examine how justified is the requirement to   remove aesthetics from the philosophy of practice in the Zagreb School,   and the consequences this requirement has on the role and position of   art. For the purpose of this problem's analysis, the author focused on   the works by Danko Grlic and Danilo Pejovic, participants in the   development of neo-Marxist philosophy, and on the interpretations by   Ozren Zunec.

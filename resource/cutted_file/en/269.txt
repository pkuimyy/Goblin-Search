AB In their article "About the Human Condition in the Works of Dickens and   Marx" Ami E. Stearns and Thomas J. Burns contribute to the study of   Charles Dickens's Industrial Revolution-era fiction by examining his   novels in relation to Karl Marx's social philosophy. Stearns and Burns   postulate that Dickens relies on Marxist concepts of class   consciousness, sacrifice, revolution, social antitheses, and social   injustice to weave his narratives and compare and discuss six of   Dickens' novels: A Tale of Two Cities, A Christmas Carol, David   Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations with three works of   Marx: Grundrisse, The Communist Manifesto, and Capital. Their analysis   suggests that the fictionalized world of Dickens parallels the   fundamental social theses in Marx's writings. Further, their study   reveals that the narratives of Dickens present Marx's concepts as   relevant and accessible within popular imagination.

TI SUFFERING FREE MARKETS: A "CLASSICAL" BUDDHIST CRITIQUE OF CAPITALIST
SO PHILOSOPHY EAST & WEST
AB This is a critique of capitalist conceptions of "value" that draws on   Dinnaga's and Dharmakirti's "exclusion of the other" semantics, Marxist   philosophy, and poststructuralist feminist and queer theories. It   diagnoses sufferings that are integral to the legal subject of   capitalist economics, and raises questions about current interpretations   of Buddhist appeals to "conventional truth."

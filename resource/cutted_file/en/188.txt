TI The iron law of democratic socialism: British and Austrian influences on
SO ECONOMY AND SOCIETY
AB A central thesis of Karl Polanyi's The great transformation concerns the   tensions between capitalism and democracy: the former embodies the   principle of inequality, while democracy represents that of equality.   This paper explores the intellectual heritage of this thesis, in the   'functional theory' of G.D.H. Cole and Otto Bauer and in the writings of   Eduard Bernstein. It scrutinizes Polanyi's relationship with Bernstein's   'evolutionary socialism' and charts his 'double movement' vis-a-vis   Marxist philosophy: in the 1910s he reacted sharply against Marxism's   deterministic excesses, but he then, in the 1920s, engaged in   sympathetic dialogue with Austro-Marxist thinkers. The latter, like   Bernstein, disavowed economic determinism and insisted upon the   importance and autonomy of ethics. Yet they simultaneously predicted a   law-like expansion of democracy from the political to the economic   arena. Analysis of this contradiction provides the basis for a   concluding discussion that reconsiders the deterministic threads in   Polanyi's oeuvre. Whereas for some Polanyi scholars these attest to his   residual attraction to Marxism, I argue that matters are more complex.   While Polanyi did repudiate the more rigidly deterministic of currents   in Marxist philosophy, those to which he was attracted, notably   Bernstein's 'revision' and Austro-Marxism, incorporated a deterministic   fatalism of their own, in respect of democratization. Herein lies a more   convincing explanation of Polanyi's incomplete escape from a   deterministic philosophy of history, as exemplified in his masterwork,   The great transformation.

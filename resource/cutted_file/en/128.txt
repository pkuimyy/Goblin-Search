SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MODERN MANAGEMENT,
AB Marxism theory education has academic and practical, this article   embarks from the academic and practical, the Marxist ideology in the   construction of our country, existing problems were discussed, and on   this basis, put forward views, reveals some of Marxism philosophy   research to ponder and must solve the problem.   Marxist theory of academic and practice is a topic discussed in studies   of Marxism in China for a long time, and in fact, the relationship   between academic and practical is a pseudo problem, because with real   academic thoughts must have practical, and practice thought has certain   theory value and practice is precondition of the academic values of;   with real practice thought not only with academic complement each other,   and with its development will be put forward higher request to academic.   With the development of the times, the academia correction of the   textbook philosophy of one-sided, from the academic level greatly   enriched the study of Marxist philosophy, including the annotation and   interpretation of Marx's philosophy of practice, Marxist philosophy of   practical discourse is revealed. But Marx's philosophy of practice is   limited to the practice of discourse, and is limited to a small academic   circle. This emergence of a strange phenomenon: the past philosophy   textbook and not much Marx on philosophy to the practice of discourse,   but with the natural revolutionary practice; discourse in current   academic circles about the Marxist philosophy practice abound, but only   words of practice and not have the real practice. The deeper reason for   the dilemma of Marx's theory research is that the study of Marx's   philosophy in contemporary China has both academic and ideological   orientation. Academic understanding of the practice of both traditional   epistemology orientation, theory of value orientation or body on the   direction, showing a trend: that is constantly to Marxist practical   concept abstraction, the a lack of reflection of divine knowledge base   and sacred social basis or sacred value basis, that is to say, it become   a certain academic action of ideology.

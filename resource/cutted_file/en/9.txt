SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB The article addresses the discussions in the field of methodology of   history of philosophy held by the Soviet philosophers in the 1970-s and   includes materials from the author's personal archive: the report   presented by him at the Symposium Methodological Problems of the History   of Philosophy and Social Thought (Leningrad, 1974). Social determination   of philosophy was not only a methodological principle of the Marxist   history of philosophy for the author, but opened the way to seeing   differences between the intemalist and externalist understanding of the   history of philosophy on the whole. Zakhar A. Kamensky's remarks in the   margin of the author's manuscript illustrate the intellectual atmosphere   of those years and the character of discussions of the period.   Addressing the question of sociomorphism and the search for the basic   "associative model", as well as describing the method of "social   introspection" characteristic of the early Ancient Greek philosophy are   a way of making the problem of socio-cultural origins and the beginning   of the Ancient Greek philosophy more specific, as it follows from the   report. The article also includes a number of clarifications and   comments on the publication of the report and lets the reader to   identify today's state of the problems it touches upon.

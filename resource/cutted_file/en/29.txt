TI Better Dread (if Still Dead) than Red: High-Brown Passing in John
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY
AB In his pioneering Caliban's Reason: Introducing Afro-Caribbean   Philosophy, Paget Henry points out that because of the region's colonial   history, Caribbean philosophy is far more often found embedded' in other   discourses, such as literature, than in explicit theorising. Following   Henry's lead, I seek to find the philosophical moral of the story' of   Voices Under the Window, the 1955 first novel of the late Jamaican   writer John Hearne (1926-94), which some critics regard as his best   work. In a novel with significant autobiographical elements, Hearne, a   high-brown' or red' Jamaican, recounts the story of Mark Lattimer,   likewise a red man' positioned at the upper edge of the brown' stratum   of the white/brown/black Jamaican social pyramid. Lattimer moves from a   race-denying attempt to pass' in World War II Britain to a Marxist   social activism upon his later return to post-war Jamaica, but is killed   in a black protest riot. His tragic fate raises important philosophical   questions about race, colour, class, and personal and social   transformation that remain very relevant today, especially considering   the failure of 1970s Anglo-Caribbean radicalism to fulfil its   revolutionary promise.

TI Milan Kangrga - Thought and Boundaries
SO FILOZOFSKA ISTRAZIVANJA
AB When we talk about 20(th) century philosophy in Southeast Europe, Milan   Kangrga is one of the names we certainly must cover Because of this, the   paper tries to provide a general presentation of his philosophical   thought, from its Praxis roots to the end of the mature, speculative   thought on the road from Kant to Hegel, and especially Marx as its final   destination. Particular attention is paid to the ethical teachings of   Milan Kangrga, as well as to the broader implications of some key   moments in his thought, notably the problem of a system of ethics   existing within a speculative Marxist framework. One of the main ideas   of the paper is that through a critical overview of the thesis of this   particular philosopher one might derive a valid point of view as far as   the philosophical trends in Southeast Europe are concerned

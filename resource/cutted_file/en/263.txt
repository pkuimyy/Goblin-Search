TI Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB Mark Fisher's Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative? is a   provocative polemical analysis of the narrowing of political horizons   that has occurred over the past couple of decades and of the powerful   ideological grip that capitalism holds on the collective, social psyche,   destroying our capacity to imagine political alternatives. Fisher seeks   to illuminate the major cultural and social efffects of a post-Cold War   politico-ideological condition in which (according to Zizek's well-known   observation) 'it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to   imagine the end of capitalism'. Building on this analysis, Fisher   identif.ies some key tensions and contradictions in the ideological   armour of contemporary capitalism and extrapolates from this some   tentative strategic propositions for the anticapitalist Left. This   review-article argues that, while Fisher's book provides valuable   conceptual and strategic resources for the Left, it is hamstrung by   several weaknesses - not the least of these a tendency to make   unconvincing, sweeping claims about the novelty and distinctness of what   Fisher terms 'capitalist realism' and a tendency to present a caricature   of current left-wing thinking.

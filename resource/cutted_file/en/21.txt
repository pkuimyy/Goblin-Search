AU Vakhitov, Rustem R.
TI The Late Losev and Marxism
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB The article is devoted to the problem of "Marxist fragments" in the   later works of A.F. Losev and especially in the "History of ancient   aesthetics". Several provisions are refuted in the article: 1) what A.F.   Losev, after the 1930s, moved to the position of Marxism; 2) what   "Marxist fragments" are no more than mimicry in order to deceive the   censorship; 3) that Losev was compelled to write like a Marxist taking   into account a censorship and without going further statement of   relative truth contained in Marxism.   The author examines the concept of the formation which is used by   Marxists, as well as by Losev and by the example of this concept proves   that Losev developed his own theory of formations based on Platonism and   the philosophy of Absolute unity. Losev's theory of formations is not   the historical idealism as well as not the historical materialism, for   he interprets society as holistic structure model without primary and   secondary components. In this model any dimension of society   (production, culture, politics) does not directly affect another but   repeats it in methodical and structural sense.

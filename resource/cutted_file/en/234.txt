AB A high degree of syncretism is achieved between Marxism and physical   situation of Chin's revolution & construction in localization of Marxism   in China. On this basis, a road adaptive to China's social development   is constructed. Localization of Marxism in China not only provides   everlasting theory for social construction and political development in   China, but also has a direct influence on development of numerous   fields, including philosophy, literature and historical research.   Therefore, localization of Marxism in China is a permanent motivation   for China's progress. In recent years, there are plentiful and   substantial achievements in research on localization of Marxism in   China. Considerable achievements have been made both in research   techniques, objects of study and research perspective. All these   achievements lay a more solid foundation for development of Marxism in   China. Exploration and analysis of theoretical research achievements of   localization of Marxism in China with a new perspective by using the   theoretical method of text and narrative pattern can result in a deep   understanding of its theoretical connotation and key points. In   addition, this kind of exploration and analysis can also provide a new   referential mode for practical significance and motive force of   development of Marxist theoretical research achievements.

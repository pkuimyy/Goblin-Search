TI A neorepublican cultural citizenship: beyond Marxism and liberalism
SO CITIZENSHIP STUDIES
AB The idea of cultural citizenship is often associated with a present-day   context of multiculturalism, and seen as a novel issue for political   philosophy. Within political philosophy it has been mainly   conceptualised within a liberal tradition focusing on (cultural) rights.   The concept also features in cultural studies, to articulate the   importance of artistic and media practices to citizenship. This article   aims to orient the debate to wider theoretical concerns, and to a   long-standing political-philosophical interest in the relation of   politics and culture. It proposes a 'broad view' of cultural   citizenship, which moreover locates cultural citizenship in concerns   about the public sphere. It revisits historical philosophical positions   on the relation of politics and culture, viz those of Karl Marx and John   Stuart Mill. The distinct conceptual models ensuing from their work both   expound 'broad views', which take the relation between politics and   culture to impact on all citizens. The article subsequently discusses a   recent Dutch policy report on cultural citizenship, which shows that   these models still have topical relevance. Next, a fourfold grid is   elaborated of weak and strong, positive and negative views on how   citizenship is to be related to issues of culture. The article concludes   by arguing for a neorepublican approach of cultural citizenship that   adopts a 'weak positive' view and may repair the conceptual drawbacks of   both the liberal and Marxist views.

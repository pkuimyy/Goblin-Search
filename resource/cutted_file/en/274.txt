AB A Kantian Utopia in Russia: Erikh Solov'ev. The article deals with Erikh   Solov'ev (b. 1934), a historian of philosophy who is one of the best   Soviet and post-Soviet exponents of Kant. In several of his works and   articles, published in the 1990s, Solov'ev has attempted to apply the   ideas of Kant's social philosophy to post-Soviet realities. Kant is   important above all as a theoretician of a free subjectivity, human   rights, and a critic of paternalism in social life. Several Kantian   motives came to the fore during the perestrojka when the Marxist "class   approach" was abandoned and "all-human" values (obsceceloveceskie   tsennosti) entered into the discussion. Later, Solov'ev attempted to   develop Kantian guidelines for a post-Soviet society, including moral   norms for businessmen in the new Russia, but these attempts bore the   distinct hallmark of social utopianism.

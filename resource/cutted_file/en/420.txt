AU ARNHART, L
TI THE SOCIOBIOLOGICAL IMAGINATION - MAXWELL,M
SO POLITICS AND THE LIFE SCIENCES
AB As the editor reports in the introduction, this volume has three goals:   (1) to acknowledge the influence of sociobiology in a wide number of   disciplines and areas of inquiry; (2) to illustrate the ways in which   practitioners of these disparate disciplines employ sociobiological   approaches in their own fields or study; and (3) to introduce major   principles of sociobiology.   Contributors assess the current and potential influence of sociobiology   in their own fields, including psychiatry (Randolph M. Nesse), law (John   H. Beckstrom), management theory (J. Gary Bernhard and Kalman Glantz),   anthropology (William Irons), economics (Robert H. Frank), primatology   (Birute Galdikas and Paul Vasey), history (Laura Betzig), political   science (Roger D. Masters), ethical philosophy (John Chandler),   cognitive psychology (Douglas Kenrick and Robert Hogan), epistemology   (Michael Ruse), religious studies (Vernon Reynolds), studies of conflict   (Johan M. G. van der Dennen), Marxist thought (Regina Karpinskaya),   aesthetics (Charles J. Lumsden), sociology (Pierre L. van den Berghe),   linguistics (james R. Hurford), and psychology (Charles Crawford). The   introductory essay includes a glossary of sociobiological terms.

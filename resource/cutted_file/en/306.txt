TI Habermas and analytical Marxism
SO PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL CRITICISM
AB John Roemer once described the 'intellectual foundations' of analytical   Marxism as the recognition that, despite having a valid core, Marxism   rested upon outdated social science. The solution, he believed, was to   update the theory 'using state-of-the-art methods of analytical   philosophy and "positivist" social science'. If one takes this   definition literally, Jurgen Habermas' early work qualifies as that of   an analytical Marxist. Yet although he developed his project in a way   that was independent of the self-identified analytical Marxists, there   are important points of convergence in their views. In particular, in   their efforts to update Marxism, both Habermas and the analytical   Marxists managed to talk themselves out of being Marxists in any   recognizable sense of the term. This is a noteworthy outcome, given the   differences in their points of departure. This article tracks the   intellectual history of these two movements, in order to identify the   tendencies that pushed this rather disparate group of theorists in the   same direction.

TI The beautiful Jew is a moneylender: Money and individuality in Simmel's
SO THEORY CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB This article contends that Georg Simmel attempted a rehabilitation of   the Jewish stereotype in a singular way: via his theory of modernity and   the quintessential place held therein by money. The first part of the   article, based almost entirely on Simmel's The Philosophy of Money,   seeks to demonstrate that Simmel intended to overturn the negative   Aristotelian and Marxist assessments of money and of those who deal with   it. The second part of the article is based on Simmel's unique theory of   type. This part seeks to establish that what Simmel in fact   rehabilitates is the Jewish type, rather than any actual historical   entity, and that this type is in fact the stereotype of the Jew.   Simmel's attempt is made in terms of existential authenticity (i.e.   truth and beauty) and in direct relation to the project of modernity   (money).

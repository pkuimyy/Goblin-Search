TI Abstraction, dissociation, and mental labor: Paul Szende's social
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB In this paper I focus on the Hungarian intellectual and politician Paul   Szende's sociologically oriented epistemology. I trace the influences of   physiology, psychology, economy, evolutionary theory of his day on his   sociological theory of abstractive knowledge, and discuss the close   connection between physiological, social, and economic aspects in the   early sociology of knowledge. My discussion continues with an   examination of Szende's differentiation between two economic effects   within social epistemology: on the one hand the 'economy of thought' in   the tradition of Ernst Mach, with its physiological, organic, and   integrative functioning of knowledge; on the other hand, the   socio-economic effects of social selection, exclusion, and societal   antagonism. Besides the Marxist and more specifically the Austro-Marxist   environment of Szende's writings, I trace the influence of the economic   theory of Italian economist Achille Loria on Szende's understanding of   the antagonistic nature of the transformation of knowledge. The paper is   set at the intersection of philosophy of science and history of science.   It relates epistemological issues to historical, social, and scientific   developments in Szende's day and thus combines a philosophical analysis   of Szende's sociological theory of knowledge with historical research   into the natural, social, and economic sciences of his time.

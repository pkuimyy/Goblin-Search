TI R.G. Collingwood's Critique of Nazism: Liberal, Marxist or Conservative?
SO POLITICS RELIGION & IDEOLOGY
AB R.G. Collingwood was one of the staunchest intellectual opponents of   Nazism in Britain throughout the interwar years and Second World War   until his death in 1943. However, the ideological basis of his   philosophical critique of Nazism is a matter of serious dispute among   scholars. It has been described as liberal, Marxist and conservative.   The aim of this article is to de-contest the ideological nature of   Collingwood's critique. Through performing a philosophical analysis on   the theoretical components that made up Collingwood's critique of   Nazism, this article rejects the Marxist reading and argues that its   ideological basis was both liberal and conservative. As a result, this   article claims that, although the liberal and conservative readings can   account for part of its ideological basis, by themselves both readings   ultimately provide inadequate accounts of Collingwood's critique.   Instead, it is only when taken together that the liberal and   conservative readings are able to adequately account for the ideological   nature of Collingwood's critique of Nazism. Indeed, this article   demonstrates that the liberal-conservative basis of Collingwood's   critique is a product of a broader tension between the two ideologies   that runs throughout his political philosophy on account of his   understanding of the dynamic nature of politics.

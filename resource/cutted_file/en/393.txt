SO POLITICAL STUDIES
AB Analytical Marxism involves the attempt to reconstruct Marxist theory   and to refocus Marxist politics in the light of contemporary   intellectual developments especially in analytical philosophy and   economic theory-and historical events above all, the failures of   Communist regimes. In order to assess this reconstruction it is   necessary to bear in mind a conception of the overall Marxist project.   By this standard of comparison it remains to be seen whether Analytical   Marxism can effect the required kind of connection between its theory   and its practice.

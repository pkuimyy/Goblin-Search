TI Dialectic of Creation and Innovation in Adolfo Sanchez Vazquez's
SO REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA-MADRID
AB This paper shows that in the philosophy of Sanchez Vazquez the basis for   creative praxis is not innovation but the activity of practical   consciousness, to which that Marxist philosopher describes as   dialectical unity of the subjective and the objective. Furthermore, the   paper argues that, in the sense of such unity and mutatis mutandi,   creation has a place in non-practical human activity.

AB With the economic development in all countries and the deteriorating   relationship between economy and environment, the implementation of   low-carbon economy has become an inevitable choice for the national   development, which means that we need to explain low-carbon economy from   economic theories. Traditional Western mainstream economics ignored   low-carbon economyin terms of the scope and the fundamental theories.   Based on the author's learning and teaching experience for many years,   this article first interprets low-carbon economy in Marx's economic   theory and proposesdevelopment measures of low-carbon economy from the   perspective of Marxist ecological philosophy.

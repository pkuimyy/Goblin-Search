TI The search for an image of man
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB The present paper offers a narrative of the post-World War II   development of Hungarian philosophy, and argues that it is characterized   by a double, historical and anthropological orientation under Marx's   influence. The resulting amalgam is an intellectual history that looks   beyond the ideas themselves, searching for underlying images of man   which are represented as ideological backgrounds to theories of nature,   society, cognition, etc. The most important works of this approach   interpret ideas and anthropologies within a Marxist framework, and see   them as closely linked to the social-historical circumstances in which   they develop; yet, these approaches represent an alternative attitude   quite different from the official ideology of dialectical materialism.

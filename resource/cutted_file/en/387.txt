SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB The Lukacs Circle in Szeged, a spontaneous, unofficial organization of   young Hungarian scholars and philosophy teachers, characteristically   represented Georg Lukacs' influence on young Hungarian intelligentsia in   the period of late socialism. In this paper, the author recalls and   critically analyses the intellectual milieu and motives that led a   considerable part of young Hungarian intelligentsia of that time to make   a cult of Lukacs' philosophy. The key to the analysis is the ambiguous   character of the political feelings and philosophical orientation of   many young people in the period of late socialism and the paradoxical   `non-bourgeois bourgeois' character of Lukacs' philosophy. Lukacs' young   followers were dissatisfied with the political conditions of 'real   socialism' and with official Marxism. However, they considered   themselves Marxists and were convinced by the anti-capitalist, romantic   idea of democratic socialism. In the eyes of his young followers, Lukacs   was a genuine philosopher whose teaching was interwoven by his   wide-ranging bourgeois middle-class education, promising both a real   philosophical alternative to official Marxism and a high-level   philosophical foundation for a non-capitalist but democratic future   human history. The author argues that Lukacs' philosophy did not satisfy   these expectations. In his political philosophy, the philosopher could   not move away from the mythological idea concerning the leading role of   the communist party and therefore could not elaborate a genuine   philosophical foundation for the idea of democratic socialism. Despite   the superiority of his philosophy, his methodology and approach to the   history of philosophy failed to provide a real philosophical alternative   to the Bolshevik tradition of Marxism.

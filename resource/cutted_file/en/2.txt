TI Dialectical critique of utopia: from Hegel to Bloch and Ellacuria
SO PENSAMIENTO
AB This article shows the stance adopted by a group of thinkers of the   dialectical tradition, from Hegel to Bloch and Ellacuria, on the concept   of utopia. It wants to show and to recover the characteristic way in   which this tradition confronts the question of utopia. In my   explanation, Ellacuria's thoughts play a special role, because of his   explicit claim to utopia as ideal, within the framework of a philosophy   being very close to Hegelian Marxism. This makes it possible to show the   peculiarity of Ellacuria's position and, at the same time, the plurality   of positions facing the problem of utopia inside the tradition of   Hegelian-marxist thought.

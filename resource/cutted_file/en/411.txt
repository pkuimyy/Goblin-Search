AU KOHAN, N
TI MARIATEGUI,JOSE,CARLOS AND HIS CRITICISM OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF UNIVERSAL
SO ARGUMENT
AB The works of Jose Carlos Mariategui still contain a new perspective for   Marxist thinking, even after the collapse of dogmatic Soviet   materialism. Kohan draws parallels between the ideas of the later Marx   and Mariategui's concept of Marxism as a model for the interpretation of   historical situations. It is still an invitation to rethink the Latin   American situation in Marxist terms.

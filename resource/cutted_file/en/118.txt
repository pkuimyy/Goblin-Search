AU Mareev, Sergei N.
TI Understand Global Capitalism (Reflections on the Book "Global Capital",
SO VOPROSY FILOSOFII
AB The reviewed book is written by two economists who have tried to create   a sort of "Capital" for XXI century. The authors demonstrate the   potential of dialectical logic (in the spirit of Evald Ilyenkov) to   expose the contradictions of the era of global capital, total market and   the virtual financial technologies. They clarified the nature of new   forms of alienation, which cannot be overcome within the framework of   general consumption. Buzgalin - Kolganov's book is a guide to   contemporary Marxist (and not only Marxist) philosophy and political   economy.

TI POSTHUMANISM THINKS THE POLITICAL: A GENEALOGY FOR FOUCAULT'S THE BIRTH
SO JOURNAL OF POSTHUMAN STUDIES-PHILOSOPHY TECHNOLOGY MEDIA
AB This article rethinks the concept of the political from a posthumanist   rather than a humanist vantage point. More specifically, it engages in   an extended discussion of Wendy Brown's Undoing the Demos and its claims   regarding the relationship between neoliberalism and the economic and   political spheres, as exemplified in Michel Foucault's lectures, The   Birth of Biopolitics. While sympathetic with Brown's views on the   deleterious effects of neoliberalism, it takes issue with her critique   of Foucault's "notorious late-1970s antagonism to Marxism" and its   effects on his understanding of the relationship between the political   and the economic, as reflected in the phenomenon of neoliberalism. This   article argues instead that Foucault's work in The Birth of Biopolitics   does indeed have an - important - genealogical relationship to Marxism,   but it is not the humanist Marxism that frames Brown's analysis. What   motivates Foucault's interest in neoliberalism is not his insufficiently   Marxist understanding of the relationship between the economic and the   political, but rather his larger - project of exploring a theory of   social - complexity in which the economic does not and cannot   unilaterally steer the other social systems, including the - political.   This understanding is utterly consonant with Foucault's larger   discussion of the qualitative shift from disciplinarity to   governmentality, and evinces a genealogical through-line from   Althusser's analysis of structural causality to Foucault's The Birth of   Biopolitics, to Luhmann's social systems theory-one that fundamentally   changes how we must think the concept of the political within a new   understanding of social complexity.

TI Charles Taylor, Marx and Marxism
SO POLITICAL STUDIES
AB Charles Taylor's engagement with Marx and the Marxist tradition has been   relatively neglected in the literature on his work. This is a strange   omission, because he was not only a pivotal figure in the development of   the New Left, but also wrote many pieces which critically engaged with   the main principles of Marx and Marxism. This paper re-examines Taylor's   engagement with Marxism and thereby exposes a neglected element in his   political philosophy. The following themes emerge: the self; Taylor's   conception of the affirmation of ordinary life; democracy; ecology; and   religion. In one area at least, the affirmation of ordinary life, a   crucial element of Marxism is retained and positively endorsed by   Taylor. in relation to the other themes, while he raises important   issues for Marxist theory, he is, at times, far too quick to dismiss   Marx's arguments and also misses similarities between those arguments   and his own work.

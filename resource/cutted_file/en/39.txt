TI Between Salafism and Eurasianism: Geidar Dzhemal and the Global Islamic
SO ISLAM AND CHRISTIAN-MUSLIM RELATIONS
AB Geidar Dzhemal was arguably the best-known mouthpiece of radical Islam   in the contemporary Russia media world: with his broad erudition in   Western philosophy, Abrahamic theology and world history, he easily   upstaged most official representatives of Islam in the country. While   his Islamic project borrowed heavily from Marxist thinking, Dzhemal's   non-conformist teaching and his personal charisma also made him famous   among right-wing thinkers, who see him as the Godfather' of Russian   converts to Islam. However, Dzhemal defied common classifications, both   political and religious; his discourse adapted to the changes in Russian   politics from Yeltsin to Putin, which allowed him to appeal to a broad   range of audiences. This article argues that his popularity can be   explained by the fact that, with his promotion of a global anti-Western   revolution under the Islamic banner, Dzhemal was still embedded in   mainstream discourses on Russia's national interests.

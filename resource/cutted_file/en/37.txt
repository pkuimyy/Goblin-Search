TI Radicality
SO FILOSOFIA POLITICA
AB The essay suggests that, during the last decades, the prevailing   discourses, both in politics and in philosophy, contributed to defuse   radicality, both of politics and of philosophy. The fall of the Berlin   Wall has fueled many irenic illusions. However, beside the normativist   ingenuities concerning the world government and the human rights   religion (that have been cynically instrumentalized in order to justify   wars-not-wars), what actually prevailed was a form of capitalistic   absolutism that has forgotten the lesson of political realism.   Neoliberal hegemony conquered the monopoly of the idea of freedom and   distorted it, while globalism interlaced the contradictory beliefs of   the Marxist vulgate. A wrong-headed hostility against the State has   brought to a devaluation of democratic sovereignty and social rights,   thus colluding with the neoliberal depoliticization.

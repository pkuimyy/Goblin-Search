TI Subject of law and the commodity form: a critical reading of the concept
SO DIREITO E PRAXIS
AB This article discusses the concept of the original position of John   Rawls. Therefore, it is necessary to study the concept in the theory of   justice and moral philosophy of Rawls, then put it in perspective, and   in dialogue with some theorists who lie in a marxist theoretical   framework: Evgeni Pachukanis, Michel Miaille, Alysson Leandro Mascaro,   Michael Lowy, Anselm Jappe, and Marx himself. Indeed, it will show that   the thought of Karl Marx, far from not considering the law, laid the   groundwork for a critical theory of liberal ideology that insinuates   itself in the writings of Rawls: though he brings the principles of   justice, and is defined as "egalitarian liberalist," the liberal ethics,   with rational individuals capable of choosing the best options and   reject social inequality essentially from a moral perspective, is   present in his work. The aim of this paper is to dig for the   inconsistencies of the concept of original position and thus raise it to   another perspective.

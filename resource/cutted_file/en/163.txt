TI Pablo Neruda, his time and the "sense of History": Ideological position
SO AYER
AB Starting fundamentally from 1936, the literature of Pablo Neruda arises   from his pessimism and assumes a new form, which is not only influenced   by contemporary political events, but also reflects a particular vision   of human evolution, conspicuously inspired by a Marxist "philosophy of   history" and shared with his fellow party members. This latter element,   as well as the permanent reconsideration of the writer's role in the   society, are clearly expressed in some of the more engaged works of   Neruda, such as Canto General, Las uvas y el viento and Cancion de   gesta.

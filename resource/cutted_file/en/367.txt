TI Between Marx and Heidegger: Politics, philosophy and Lefebvre's The
SO ANTIPODE
AB This article argues that the work of Martin Heidegger is extremely   important in understanding Henri Lefebvre's intellectual project. It   suggests that Lefebvre's trio of influential thinkers-Hegel, Marx and   Nietzsche- are partnered by Heidegger. But this is Heidegger read in a   particular way, and subjected to a Marxist critique-turned back on his   feet, grounded, made real.   This is pursued in detail through a rereading of Lefebvre's The   Production of Space. The two terms in this title need to be examined,   and while the importance of space develops a number of insights from   Heidegger, the stress on production shows the political and Marxist   nature of this research. The Production of Space is therefore situated,   and needs to be read, between Marx and Heidegger. The article closes   with some comments on the interrelation of history, space and politics,   and offers the possibility of a left-Heideggerianism.

TI Materiality, Time and Desire: the Criticism of Christian Mythology in
SO Alpha-Revista de Artes Letras y Filosofia
AB This text focuses on the last part of the theoretical production of Leon   Rozitchner, in which he assesses the structuring myth of our culture:   Christianism. By means of a Freudian interpretation of Saint Augustin's   "Confessions", Rozitchner retakes in an original way the Marxist idea of   criticism of religion as the presumption of every criticism. The   religious core hidden by modern secularization, hindered by capitalism,   is revealed, and the notion of a corpus emerges, which allows critical   revision of ancient dichotomies beset by religion, in order to open   paths towards new ways of telling History. From the perspective of   historical materialism, we try to put forward the passage from criticism   of ideology to criticism of mythology. The latter promotes a reflection   on the symbolic foundations that may give way to emancipatory processes.   Finally, we show that in Rozitchner's work, the will to construct a   theory of the subject and the criticism of culture is the result of a   perennial reflection on identity in itself.

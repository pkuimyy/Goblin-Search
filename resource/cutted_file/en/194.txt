TI Howie's Between Feminism and Materialism and the Critical History of
SO SOPHIA
AB This essay traces the notion of abstraction through the works of Gillian   Howie as a means of thinking through the nature of critique within   philosophy of religion. In particular, it argues that Howie's recovery   of a more productive conception of abstraction in her late Between   Feminism and Materialism is closely linked to the resurgence of real   abstraction in recent Marxist theory. From these shifts, one can derive   both an enriched conception of religion as real abstraction and a method   of critical history that offers a genuine alternative within the   contemporary study of philosophy of religion.

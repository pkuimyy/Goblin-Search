TI Salvaging the Symbol in Muriel Rukeyser's The Book of the Dead
SO COMPARATIVE CRITICAL STUDIES
AB The essay seeks to set the framework by which we may appraise the   efficacy of the salvaging strategies employed by Muriel Rukeyser's   poetic response to the Hawk's Nest Tunnel Disaster in West Virginia in   her collection, The Book of the Dead (1938). In seeking to reclaim the   lost experiences and objects of exploited miners, Rukeyser's project to   salvage their anonymous suffering at the hands of capitalist greed   places her as an artist within the historical materialist tradition   outlined in Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History   (1942). The Book of the Dead explores the legacy of European   capitalism's displacement of the Native-American Asiatic' society as   delineated by Marx in the Grundrisse (1939). It is argued that Rukeyser   aims to salvage the signs and materials of industrial conflict, such as   the insurrectionary figure of John Brown, in order to begin to create   the always-unfinished symbol' against the misappropriating machinations   of capitalism, continuing the work of poets such as Herman Melville. The   essay argues that Rukeyser's symbolic framework which aims to spur the   subjective worker to action through imagination invokes a 'Hydraulic   state', as in ancient Egypt, inspiring a quasi-religious submission to   the higher unity of the hydroelectric dam and those who died creating   it. Finally, we explore the implications where this spur to collective   working-class action depends upon the consciousness of the human   conduit: the irony at the heart of Marxist autonomy.

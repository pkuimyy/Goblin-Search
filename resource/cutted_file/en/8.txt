These   analyses of alienation are divided into: philosophical theories,   investigating different aspects of the theories of alienation all and   every author did that; practical sociological analyses with an object to   reflect on the specific social reality (socialist society) through the   aspect of alienation (J. Repgys, J. Minkevicius). Specifying   theoretically the works could be grouped into: those of Marx himself,   his analyzes of the concept of alienation, with an emphasis on   historical (E. Krakauskas) or ideological (J. Karosas, A. Lozuraitis)   traits; consideration of the alienation within the context of the other   themes, namely, of humanism (J. Morkuniene), ethics (D. Kapaciauskiene),   anthropology (J. Minkevicius); application of marxist methodology in the   critique of concepts of alienation in other philosophical trends.

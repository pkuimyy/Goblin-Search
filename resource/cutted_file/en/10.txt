SO CESKA LITERATURA
AB This study focuses on a particular distinctive moment in the Czech and   French history of literary thinking which took place in the latter half   of the 1960s and which saw not only an encounter of Marxism and   structuralism, but also a shift and radical change in the conception of   literary structure. Marxist philosopher and historian Robert   Kalivodapresents the development of Jan Mukarovsky's structural literary   aesthetics from a Marxist and Freudian perspective; according to him,   Mukarovsky's conception matured in association with the production and   reflection of the interwar artistic avant-garde (Karel Teige) towards a   conception of aesthetic function and value as transparent anthropic   principles and work of art as a dynamic ensemble of extra-aesthetic   functions and values. Simultaneously, the representative of French   Althusserian Marxism Pierre Macherey formulates his conception of   literary output as a specific mode in the production of speech and   literary structure as a space of difference, in which the ideological   universalizations of the period are unconsciously presented in a   critical light. Within the Czech structuralist tradition and in harmony   with its avant-garde pedigree - a parallel conception then emerges   within the works of Oleg Sus and Milan Jankovic of literary structure as   a structure that is unconsolidated and unconsolidatable, as the process   and action of meaning, the movement of contradictions that will not have   culminated in a final and completed synthesis. Analysis of the internal   contexts and interrelations of these conceptions leads us to interpret   them as the movement of concurrent - misses a radical change in the   structure and the opening of its dialectics here has different   resonances, caused by a different conception of the subject and the   relationship between the work and the social structure and also a failed   meeting, whose connections have for the most part hitherto escaped the   attention of literary studies and philosphy historians.

TI Reforming the Teaching Content of Marxist Philosophy
SO 2012 2ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED SOCIAL SCIENCE (ICASS
AB Some problems on the Marxism philosophy teaching content have caused   wide concern: putting undue emphasis on the concreteness, preciseness,   stability of the content and the political education function, while   ignoring the nature, the time spirit, the development, the versatility   of the philosophy. In order to help students establish a correct outlook   of world, life and value, Marxist philosophy teaching should introduce   more basic knowledge of philosophy, follow the development tracks of   theory and practice in philosophy.

TI Reconstructing Vaross's Views on Philosophy
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The paper explores Vaross's understanding of philosophy, his   philosophical stand, undoubtedly influenced by Popper's critical   realism, as well as Vaross's critique of Marxist dialectic and the unity   of psychology and philosophy which is inherent in all his works.   Vaross's axiology as the main focus of the author, is seen as relevant   not only for theory, but also for applied disciplines, such as ethics,   aesthetics, theory and critique of visual arts.

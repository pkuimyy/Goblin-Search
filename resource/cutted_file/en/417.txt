AU HUDELSON, R
TI HAS HISTORY REFUTED MARXISM
SO PHILOSOPHY OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES
AB This article considers the significance of the fall of communism for the   question of the truth of Marxism. It begins by considering some Marxist   theories of Stalinism and some Marxist criticisms of Bolshevism. Having   rejected the adequacy of those theories, the author goes on to argue   that while Stalinism in part rests on a nonmarket vision of socialism   derived from Marx, contrary to an argument of Carl Cohen, this vision is   not deeply rooted in Marxist philosophy.

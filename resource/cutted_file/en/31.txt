AB Dermeval Saviani analyzes the educational work using the marxist   approach, articulating issues relating to philosophy and history of   education, educational policy and educational theory, providing inputs   for coping with the emptying process suffered by the the school   curriculum. From the contribution of Saviani and others regarding the   construction of the historical-critical pedagogy, some curricular   principles for the theachig content selection can be formulated. As an   example, the question of the classics is pointed out by Saviani as a   reference for the selection of school subjects. The category of freedom   is understood following the marxist tradition in a way opposed to the   liberal-bourgeois point of view based on the historical analysis of the   construction of sociability and culture using work as foundation. This   historical perspective gives meaning to the ideas proposed by Saviani   regarding knowledge, human education and school curriculum.

TI After Nikolai Bukharin: History of science and cultural hegemony at the
SO HISTORY OF THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB This article addresses the ideological context of twentieth-century   history of science as it emerged and was discussed at the threshold of   the Cold War. It is claimed that the bifurcation of the discipline into   a socio-economic strand and a technical-intellectual one (the divide   between externalism' and internalism') should be traced back to the   1930s. In fact, the proposal of a Marxist-oriented historiography by the   Soviet delegates at the International Congress of History of Science and   Technology (London, 1931) led by Nikolai Bukharin, set off the   ideological and methodological opposition that characterised the later   years. Bukharin's views on science are closely considered, as well as   those of his Marxist critics, Gyorgy Lukacs and Antonio Gramsci. It is   argued that, despite the fluidity of the positions of the 1920s and   1930s, these theories soon crystallized as demonstrated by the leftist   reception of Bukharin's and his associates' perspective in the history   of science, especially in Great Britain, as well as by the   anti-communist reactions. Intellectualist approaches renouncing   socio-economic factors, typically those by Alexandre Koyre and Thomas   Kuhn, are reconsidered in the light of the ideological confrontation of   the Cold War era. Reflection on the political-cultural embedding of the   history of science has often been overshadowed by claims about the   objectivity and neutrality of science and its historiography. Thus, the   seminal discussion of the 1930s remains one of the most lucid moments of   reflection about the role of science and history of science as cultural   phenomena shaped by political struggles.

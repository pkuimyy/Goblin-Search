TI SOCIOLOGY AND EPISTEMOLOGY: EXCHANGING COGNITIVE EXPERIENCE
SO EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
AB The paper examines modern sociology the experience of which enriches   social epistemology and philosophy of science. The problem of a   universal, general theory is very hard do deal with, though it had   emerged as early as in the epoch of Enlightenment. The paper discusses   whether a general theory is possible and a methodological role played in   its creation by "middle range theories", that is the approach proposed   by American sociologist R. Merton. The methodological structure of   Marxist theory, traditionally seen as "the general theory", is under   critical scrutiny. Another aspect of sociological methodology   development is G. Ritzer's ideas of "an integrated sociological   paradigm" and also of "a multiply paradigm science". This approach is   used to analyze "a degree of generality" of sociological theories. J.R.   Searle's interpretation of the nature of facts in social sciences, where   facts may get an objective status because of an agreement between   members of society, is also discussed. On the whole, the paper comes to   the conclusion that philosophical and methodological problems in the   cognitive experience of modern sociology are diverse and important.

TI On the Teaching Method of the Course of the Basic Tenets of Marxism
SO 2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUSINESS, ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT (BEM
AB The course of the Basic Tenets of Marxism, which has many knowledge   points, comes from three courses: the Principles of Marxist Philosophy,   Marxist Political Economics and Scientific Socialism. It is a time too   short to teach all the knowledge points adequately. We need transform   the textbooks system to the teaching system in specific teaching   practices. In the same class there are students who majored in liberal   arts, science and engineering courses, they have different disciplin   background. We need follow the teaching principle of "to give prominence   to the key points, let one unit guide a whole area" in order to solve   all the difficulties.

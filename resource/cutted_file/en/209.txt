TI Escaping the Throne Room Peter Thomas and the Gramscian Moment
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB In The Gramscian Moment Peter Thomas fundamentally revises the   'textbook' Gramsci - a theorist whose work centred on a primordial   East/West distinction, focused on the superstructure, and upon the ways   a ruling class secured subaltern consent to its rule. Placing special   emphasis on the Notebooks from 1932, Thomas critiques readings of   Gramsci by Perry Anderson and Louis Althusser, and finds that Gramsci   articulated the 'philosophy of praxis' not so much as a synonym for, or   declaration of independence from, Marxism, but rather as a tendency   within Marx's legacy that Gramsci hoped to make hegemonic within the   working-class movement. Two friendly amendments emerge with respect to   this persuasive account. First, the emphasis on Gramsci's philosophy   leads the author to an over-simplified account of the role of   evolutionary theory within Gramsci's own perspective and privileges   'philosophy' over other fields to which Gramsci's vision was even more   decisive. Is the 'Gramscian moment' really best analysed by looking at   those intellectuals commonly deemed philosophers? And second, does not   this moment also entail a more fundamental rethinking of the orthodox   concepts and methods of revolutionary-left historiography than the   author sometimes implies?

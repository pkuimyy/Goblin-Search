TI Milan Zigo's Philosophico-Literary Activity in the 1960s
SO FILOZOFIA
AB The contribution offers a critical survey of philosophico-literary   writings of the Slovak philosopher Milan Zigo (with a special attention   paid to his reflections and reviews) which appeared in the 1960s in the   journal Slovenske pohl'ady. Distinctive features of Zigo's insights are   identified, whose leitmotif is seen by the author as Zigo's implicitly   critical attitude towards the one-sided ideologization of Marxist   philosophy. Further, attention is paid to particular issues investigated   by Zigo: underlined is his understanding of humanism, the relationship   between philosophy and humanities, as well as between philosophy and   literature and, last, but not least, the dialogue with Western   philosophies.

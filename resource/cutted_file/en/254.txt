AU Ankersmit, Frank
TI THE DIALECTICS OF JAMESON'S DIALECTICS
SO HISTORY AND THEORY
AB This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against   the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would   invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose   writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into   three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics,   the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In   the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our   relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in.   The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down   his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of   his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own   philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is   his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear   that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of   history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological   approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of   dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of   historical writing.

TI Semantics and critique of political economy in Adam Schaff
SO SEMIOTICA
AB Adam Schaff (b. March 10, 1913, Lwow - d November 12, 2006 Warsaw,) was   a Polish Marxist philosopher with a special interest in philosophy of   language and semiotics, in theory of knowledge and political economy. He   focused on problems of semantics, theory of ideology the relation   between language and reality, formal logic, and dialectics. But he also   showed a great interest in ethics dealing with the problem of the human   individual and the relation between humanism and Marxism. Concerning   this aspect he evidenced the connection between the interpretation of   Marxism and translation of Marxian terminology, showing the influence of   ideology in the practice of translation. As a polish philosopher, Schaff   oriented his analysis in a semiotic sense, examining in particular the   symptomatology of today's social politics. During the 1980s. he promoted   a series of meetings in different countries throughout Eastern and   Western Europe to analyze and compare the different versions in   different languages of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 from a semiotic   perspective. Certain of the topical relevance of his work in semiotics,   in this paper we examine a series of issues at the center of Schaff's   attention such as the conception of the human individual, the relation   between language and knowledge, language and dialectics, the influence   of ideology in translation, linguistic fetishism and stereotypes,   critique of Chomskyian theory of language, and of hypostatization of   such concepts as "structure" and "structuralism."

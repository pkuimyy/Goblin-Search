TI What Is a Philosophical Tendency?
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB This article clarifies and resituates Althusser's materialist   philosophical project in relation not only to such predecessors as V.I.   Lenin and Jean-Toussaint Desanti but also to such successors as Pierre   Macherey and Pierre Raymond. The thesis of the article is that   Althusser's project to establish a philosophical practice that would be   appropriate for Marxism did not simply consist of identifying and   defending a 'materialist' position in philosophy against external   'idealist' challenges or threats. On the contrary, it recognised that   there exists an interminable struggle between inextricably linked but   ever-shifting materialist and idealist tendencies a struggle that   operates as a defining feature in the history of philosophy. As a   result, the problem explored in this article concerns how best to   conceptualise this struggle and to determine whether or not the term   'tendency' genuinely holds analytical value and can serve as an   important conceptual resource for Marxists working within the field of   philosophy.

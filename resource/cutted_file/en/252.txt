TI Language, Knowledge and Neo-Marxism-An Evaluation of Adam Schaff's
SO UNIVERSITAS-MONTHLY REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY AND CULTURE
AB Adam Schaff, the prominent philosopher of the contemporary Poland has   profoundly deepened our knowledge about semantics, semiology,   epistemology and the sciences of man in general as well as language. His   novel and original interpretation of Marxism paves the new way to our   understanding of East European Neo-Marxism. For him Marx's early   writings which deal with human individual and alienation, constitute the   core of a new brand of humanism. According to him, the Marxian thought   can be epitomized as the radical, militant, integrative, optimistic and   even scientific humanism. It is not only different from Sartre's   abstract existentialism, but also opposite to Althusser's anti-humanist   structuralism. This article firstly introduces the readers to the basic   ideas of language, knowledge and semantics presented by Schaff. It   discusses then Marxian concept of alienation in social relations and the   role of human individual by the invention, internalization and   application of language. Further, this treatise elaborates Schaff's   analysis of the possibility how each and every individual can achieve   his/her happiness and emancipation through human creativity and   self-realization. Apart from supporting Marxist violent class struggle,   Schaff did not reject the peaceful social evolution, especially social   reform and parliamentary democracy as an alternative means to the   transformation of society. In conclusion, the Marxist tradition of the   unity of theory and praxis is manifest in Schaff's concern with the   severe predicament of human beings in the present-day world and the   various approaches he adopted to tackle it, especially in the later part   (1970-2003) of his long assiduous academic life (1913-2006).

TI Was the Original Lokayata a 'Live-in-the-Present' Spiritualistic
SO JOURNAL OF INDIAN COUNCIL OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
AB Introduction Almost all schools of Indian philosophy including Buddhism   and Jainism have condemned Lokayata as a very base philosophy and   relegated it to an uncivilized and unethical status that deserved no   merit or appreciation. On the other hand, many modern scholars who   focused on the study of Lokayata invariably looked at it from the   Marxist ideological perspective, only finding in it a school revolting   against spiritualism of the then-extant Vedic schools and even class   conflict between the priest class and the commoners. Since no original   work of this school survives intact to the present day, it is difficult   to comprehend its true line of thought only from very scanty and   dispersed statements and verses attributed to it in the works of other   schools.   Discussion While medieval philosophers painted it negatively,   exaggerating only its weak points and even interpreting its aphorisms to   be base and mean, modern scholars want us to believe that Lokayata   represents class conflict and is antithetical to spiritualism. But if it   were just a base and laymen's ideology, how did it survive over two   millennia compelling every other school of philosophy to comment on it?   Conclusion Is it possible that the original Lokayata school tried to   present something significant, but it was disparagingly combined with   other inferior ideologies by its adversaries with malfeasance and   interpreted it wrongly to make it look base and mean? Has Lokayata got a   lot more to offer than just being an anti-fiefdom ideology? This paper   tries to examine the tenets of Lokayata school that are in vogue and   suggests the possibility that Lokayata could have been a   'live-in-the-present' spiritual school like the Zen.

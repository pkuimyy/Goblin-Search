TI THE PROBLEM OF MICHEL MIAILLE'S ESSENTIALISM IN LIGHT OF FRIEDRICH
SO QUAESTIO IURIS
AB The article focuses on the dialectical-materialist theory of Michel   Miaille and aims to analyze the existence of an essentialist assumption   in such a theory. While theory oflaw, the dialectic-Marxist Miaille, in   short, seeks to explain the legal phenomenon of the society, breaking   both with legal positivism as with the natural law. The right is defined   in its social structure, with the possible exclusion of essentialism of   his analysis. Still, it seems that there is an essentialist assumption   in thinking Miaille, both as a constituent of the holistic method, and   by linking the right to social justice. Therefore, methodologically, the   research will examine whether there is indeed an essentialist assumption   in thinking Miaille and sequentially, the problem of essentialism in the   light of Nietzsche's philosophy. From the performed analysis of critical   philosophy of Nietzsche, the article concludes that the dialectical   materialist theory of Michel Miaille submit a rhetorical importance, but   fails to seek to extract a possible truth of the social structure that   justifies the conceptoflaw presented by the author.

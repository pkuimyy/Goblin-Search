TI Reflections of Kant's Philosophy in Slovakia in the Years 1945 - 1989
SO STUDIA PHILOSOPHICA KANTIANA
AB The paper focuses on the analysis of reflections of Kant's philosophy in   Slovakia after WWII. The hypothesis based on the assumption that after   the war there will be an increased interest in Kant in the Slovak   intellectual circles (similarly to the situation in the Czech Republic)   was not confirmed. It is a historical paradox that only after 1948 with   a new political regime of Marxist-Leninist orientation in   Czechoslovakia, Kant was recognized on the basis of massively published   works of the "classic" authors, especially V. I. Lenin, who reminded the   idea of F. Engels, that German classical philosophy represents one of   the theoretical sources of Marxism.

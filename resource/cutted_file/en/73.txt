TI The invisible Organon. The theological grammar of Benjaminian time
SO ENRAHONAR-QUADERNS DE FILOSOFIA
AB It is while refuting the idea of progress that the 'confession' on   theology burst on the Passagen-Werk: "My thinking is to theology as   blotting paper is to ink. It is completely saturated with it. But if the   blotting paper had its way, nothing would remain of what was written"   (PW N7a7). The kind of theological invisibility confessed here as in a   heretic palimpsest is part of a trick which was familiar to cabbalistic   studies: to make one's own text invisible. What seems to be particular   to Benjamin, however, is the agonistic but nevertheless heuristic way in   which he intends to use theology in order to shake, disarray and   deconstruct the established philosophy, particularly its dominant trends   in the field of the theory of history: historicism, positivism and the   evolutionary Hegelian-Marxist philosophy of history. In this paper we   try to show how this theological perspective is applied to a Benjaminian   grammar of time. We conclude by comparing the resulting Benjaminian   notion of historical past both against a text of young Heiddeger (1915)   and a fragment of Max Horkheimer (1937).

TI The Question of Radicalism in Sheldon Wolin's Political Thought: A
SO CRITICAL SOCIOLOGY
AB It is widely accepted that Sheldon Wolin has revitalized the tradition   of radicalism in the context of modern political thought, as evidenced   by his contribution to the debate on the so-called death of political   philosophy and his forceful critique of Rawls and modern political   liberalism. However, Wolin's fugitive democracy has met with opposition.   This paper investigates fugitive democracy from a Marxist perspective   and questions whether fugitive democracy can actually confront crucial   socio-political issues such as the lack of democracy for the masses in   the production of social wealth. Moreover, Wolin's misinterpretation and   rejection of Marx's theory of democracy and politics leads him to a   misconceived view of the Marxian philosophy of history and the progress   of political societies as a whole, a misconception that leads to   inconsistencies within his own work. And finally, although Wolin seems   to be a radical democrat and appears to hold a worldview close to that   of socialists, he in fact, despite his criticisms, follows a liberal   logic.

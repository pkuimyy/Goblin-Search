TI Marx in Relation to Subjectivity and Despair According to Kierkegaard
SO QUAESTIONES DISPUTATAE
AB According to Sartre, some marxist ideas have been interpreted   incorrectly by leaders such as Stalin, impeding the accurate application   of Marx's ideas, leaving a bloodstain of violence in the historic record   called "fraternity-terror": this is nothing more that the imposition of   socialism by violent means. As such, the French existentialist resorts   to Freudian psychoanalysis, to Kierkegaard's existential roots and some   of his own philosophical concepts with the aim to restructure the   execution of Marx's ideas, which resulted in failure at the beginning of   the twentieth century. Sartre exposes the shortcomings of Marxists as   well as the different causes that have led to capitalism being the   dominant socioeconomic system. That said, capitalism has also   dehumanised the individual by annihilating their subjectivity. In   Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard conceptualises despair as a fatal   sickness, which highlights man's need to fulfil himself subjectively.   The Objective of this article is to carry out a hermeneutical study of   the notion of despair according to Soren Kierkegaard, examining how it   relates to the concept of subjectivity according to Sartre, Marx and   some neo-Marxists, approaching some current critiques of Marx and   Kierkgaards before arriving at Postmodernism through Slavoj Zizek; it   aims to highlight the incongruences of Marxism and capitalism in the   negation of subjectivity. The return to the existential concept of   despair as understood by the Danish philosopher does not seek to   identify coincidences with Marxist philosophy but instead seeks to   reflect critically upon the meaning of subjectivity nowadays.

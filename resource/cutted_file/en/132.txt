TI History of Political Thought as Detective-Work
SO HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS
AB This paper offers practical guidance for empirical interpretation in the   history of political thought, especially uncovering what authors meant   and why they wrote what they wrote. I thus seek to fill a small but   significant hole in our rather abstract methodological literature. To   counter this abstraction, I draw not only on methodological theorising   but also on actual practiceand on detective-work, a fruitful analogy.   The detective analogy seeks to capture the intuition that we can   potentially find right answers but must handle fragmentary evidence that   different people can plausibly read in different ways. Placing the focus   on evidence, and on combining different types of evidence, suggests that   orthodox categories like contextualist' and Marxist' too often   accentuate differences between scholars. This paper instead highlights   core principles that unite usideas that underpin good textual   interpretation across all schools of thought'.

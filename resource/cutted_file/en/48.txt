SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB The article seeks to fill a lacuna in Marxist scholarship concerning the   actually-existing Marxism of politically-mobilised workers as an organic   philosophy in its own right. To shed light on this issue, I investigate   the reading-material which stimulated Marxist conversion and the   accompanying intellectual invigoration of workers at the turn of the   twentieth century in Russian Poland. For proletarian readers Marxism was   the main political language, ushering them into the public sphere and   allowing them to comprehend the emerging capitalist world. As a   particular liaison of scientific knowledge and a practical political   weapon, it allowed its adherents to redefine themselves and make   political claims. Such a situational Marxism, drawing from but not   reducible to the prevailing 'orthodoxy', allows one to see the latter as   a socially diverse plethora of ideas.

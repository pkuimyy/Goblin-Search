TI Theorizing health inequalities: The untapped potential of dialectical
SO SOCIAL THEORY & HEALTH
AB We here extend our previous contributions to a neo-Marxist sociology of   health inequalities via an engagement with Roy Bhaskar's dialectical   critical realism (DCR). We argue that Bhaskar's re-grounding of the   philosophies of Marx and Engels has the potential to re-invigorate   sociology's input into: (a) explanations of health inequalities and (b)   interventions to reduce health inequalities. We also show that DCR   provides rationale and opportunity for an action sociology beyond   current professional, policy, critical and public sociologies. We   briefly summarize current sociological models of health inequalities   before protesting their lack of theoretical ambition. We then proffer a   professional-cum-critical theory that emphasizes the continuing causal   efficacy of social class in general, and of Britain's 'governing   oligarchy' in particular, for any credible sociological account of   health inequalities. Bhaskar's basic and dialectical critical realism   are then introduced and the frame supplied by the latter commended for a   deepening of the neo-Marxist theories of health inequalities being   developed by us among others. The article concludes by drawing on this   same frame to insist on a logical and moral commitment to an action   sociology beyond any institutional constraints faced by practitioners of   the discipline.

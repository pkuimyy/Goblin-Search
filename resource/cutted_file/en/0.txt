TI CRITICAL REALISM AND THE ONTOLOGICAL CRITIQUE OF ECONOMICS METHODOLOGY
SO EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
AB The objective of this paper is to defend the importance of ontological   critique of the mainstream economics. To do so, we examine the   methodological arguments of Tony Lawson who, inspired by the critical   realism philosophy, advocates in favor of realistic, non-deductive and   ontology-aware economics to solve problems of contemporary economic   theory. This article proposes that, although correct in the logic of its   argument, Lawson's critique of the mainstream is not able to explain the   social reasons for its existence and reproduction. And if so, Lawson's   critique is not ontological. It can be stated that a project of   generally reorienting economics methodology is impossible in case the   social reason for its orthodox existence is maintained. Some substantial   insights can be found in the Marx's ontological critique of capitalism   and also in the Critical Realism philosophy. Therefore, we propose an   explanation for the enduring deductivism and empirical realism in   economics from a Marxist perspective.

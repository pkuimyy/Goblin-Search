TI Alchemist of the Revolution: The Affective Materialism of Georges
SO THIRD TEXT
AB This article examines Georges Bataille's notion of   revolution-as-festival and his attempt, in his writing of the 1930s, to   place theories of affect within the framework of Marxist philosophy.   Against the various negative characterisations of this project, it looks   at Bataille's ideas in this period in context, in order to understand   their vivid contradictions as an attempt to assert a positive project of   affect's utility to the Left, within and against negative categories in   early twentieth-century cultural and critical thought.

AU Rockmore, T
TI Merleau-Ponty, Marx, and Marxism: The problem of history
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB At the present time, Europe, particularly eastern Europe, is still   immersed in a major political transformation, the most significant such   change since the Second World War, arising out of the rejection of   official Marxism. This unforeseen rejection requires meditation by all   those concerned with the relation of philosophy to the historical   context. Marxism, that follows Marx's insistence on the link between a   theory and the context in which it arises, cannot be indifferent to the   rejection of Marxist theory in practice. In respect to the usual   tendency to pass rapidly over practice for a theoretical analysis of   social theory, Merleau-Ponty stands out for his concern to evaluate the   theoretical claims of Marx and Marxism against practice.

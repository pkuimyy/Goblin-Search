TI Jerry and Jewry: Ethnicity and Humanity in GA Cohen
SO UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO QUARTERLY
AB If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich? presents Gerald A.   (Jerry) Cohen's musings on his ethnic identity. The interplay between   the personal reflections, central to which is Cohen's communist Jewish   upbringing in Montreal, and the philosophical position that Cohen holds,   sheds Canadian light on the foundations of Western culture. Although he   identified as Jewish throughout his life, Judaism Cohen rejected. Too,   as a Marxist early, a luck egalitarian later, he was critical of the   liberalism that Jewish people (certainly those of his native Montreal)   embrace. Most Jewish Canadians self-classify as secular Jews. Cohen is   right to waver, but not because, as he incorrectly avers, being a Jew is   in tension with irreligiosity. Cohen does not qualify as a secular Jew   because he does not qualify as a Jew at all. His philosophy disqualifies   him. What is it to be a Jew? The Hebrew Bible contains the answer.   Against the then-regnant, pagan, belief system, the Bible advances a   conception of a person as an effective locus of action within the system   that is nature. This conception is the essence of humanism. In effect,   being a Jew is an ethnically inflected form of being, in the dominant   Western sense, a person. As distinct from adhering to Judaism, or being   Jewish, being a Jew associates more than just voluntarily with   liberalism. The religion-friendly irreligiosity of the secular Jews of   Montreal turns out, then, to link with a value embedded deep in Canadian   political life. Cohen's philosophical anthropology, enmeshing men and   women in a wider whole, socio-economic (Marxism) or natural (luck   egalitarianism), marks him as a neo-pagan. As to Cohen's Jewishness,   even a pagan can eat bagels and speak Yiddish.

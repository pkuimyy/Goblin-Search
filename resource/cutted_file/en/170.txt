TI Pragmatic Hegemony: Questions and Convergence
SO JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY
AB The question concerning the connection of scientific inquiry to   democratic praxis is central to both Antonio Gramsci and John Dewey.   They share a common philosophical origin in Hegel and are essentially   both in the tradition of Left Hegelian thought. Likewise, their   respective analyses of the forces obstructing democratic emancipation   were sharply focused on the distortions of social life caused by   economic agents cooperating under hugely unequal power relations. As   Gramsci wrote from his prison cell from 1929 to 1937 in Italy, Dewey   went through his most fruitful philosophical period in the United   States, including his writings on politics and democracy. They both   found targets of critique by diagnosing the pathologies of public life   resulting from the power of private capital interests in collusion with   a co-opted representative body, the authoritarian crimes and attendant   culture of fascism, and the theoretical rigidity of the Soviet Marxists.   In addition, true to their Hegelian roots, they marshaled their   critiques of the abstractions of liberalism and its attendant moral and   economic theory by insisting on the embedded, cultural, and historically   deep contexts in which emancipatory practice need take place.

TI A Marxist Education of the Encounter: Althusser, Interpellation, and the
SO RETHINKING MARXISM-A JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS CULTURE & SOCIETY
AB This essay traces out a new organization of Louis Althusser's work that   rests on his fundamental educational problematic: interpellation. There   are three moments where Althusser discusses education in his writings:   in the famous essay on schools as Ideological State Apparatuses, in his   infamous essay on the university and the pedagogical function, and in a   much more obscure reference to trade unions. In all three, Althusser is   dealing with the problem of interpellation, yet none of these essays   enable us to actually theorize what Althusser's own practice of the   seminar offers as educational logic-a practice that resulted in the   student-teacher collaboration Reading Capital. In short, whereas the   Institutional State Apparatus interpellates individuals and the trade   union offers a counterinterpellation, the seminar is a form of   disinterpellation that must be thought of as the educational unconscious   of Althusser's late writings on the encounter.

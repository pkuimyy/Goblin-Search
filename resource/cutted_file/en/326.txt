TI Barthes without Althusser: A different style of Marxism (Roland Barthes)
SO PARAGRAPH
AB The first section of the essay assesses the similitude and differences   between the Althusserian concept of ideology and Barthes's concept of   'ideosphere', as developed in the seminar on the Neutral. The second   section rehearses the different stages of Barthes's complex relation to   Marxism and suggests that, in spite of the explicit rejection of the   doctrine, there remains a Marxist substratum to Barthes's thought. The   third section compares the two theories of ideology and shows that   Barthes's insistence on the centrality of language allows him to offer a   more comprehensive account of ideology: what begins in a form of   allusion to Marxism ends up at a certain distance. The last section   wonders what contribution Barthes's theory of ideosphere can make to a   Marxist philosophy of language: one unexpected aspect of the answer   makes use of the concept of style.

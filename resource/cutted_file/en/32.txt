SO POLICY FUTURES IN EDUCATION
AB In Peter McLaren's words We need a philosophically grounded alternative   to capitalism, but what does such a philosophical grounding look like?   Need it be shared? The philosophical basis for practice was not shared   by Lenin and Bogdanov, for example, and yet both retained the ability to   work together in the Bolshevik party. There's a profound difference   between god-building, and god-seeking. Socialists have strong traditions   of both. Peter McLaren's recent work fits into the latter category. I   will engage with this project, because I think Peter's position, whilst   honourable, lacks the visionary power of the former. And to these I   would like to add a third position, one which seeks to extend to all of   the material universe and to all living things a sacred character, but   without any requirement for categories such as god. There are of course   many mystic traditions which espouse something similar, but relatively   few socialists have developed politically this position, as espoused by   the tanner-philosopher Josef Dietzgen (though there are certainly close   links between Dietzgenism and god-building). My argument for raising   such seemingly arcane concerns, is rather similar to that of Lenin whose   immersion in philosophy in writing Materialism and Empirio-Criticism   primarily met the political requirements of the day. Amidst ubiquitous   talk of the Anthropocene, and a sudden rise in interest in Bogdanov on   the Marxist left, now is the moment to look to the prospect of taking up   a Bogdanovite project, not to build a new god, but to re-sacralise   nature. In this paper, I begin to mobilise an unlikely alliance around   this vision: not only Dietzgen, but deep ecologists and even Jiddu   Krishnamurti assist in exploring the limitations of McLaren's position.

AB The article analyzes the critique made by Walter Benjamin against the   traditional method of historical research in the modern age. It intends   to be a systematic and specific discussion of the concepts of history,   experience and tradition in Benjamin's essay On the Concept of History   (a.k.a. Theses on the Philosophy of History). It also intends to recover   some philosophical problems adjacent to the field of historical   research, such as the relation between man and time, language and   politics (considering the Marxist idea of class struggle).

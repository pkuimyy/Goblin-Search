TI The material memory of history: Edgar Zilsel's epistemology of
SO STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
AB The paper focuses on the concept of matter and the material in Edgar   Zilsel's considerations about historiographical methods in the context   of the Marxist debates on the materialist conception of history in the   1920s and 1930s (Gyorgy Lukacs, Max Adler). It sheds light on Zilsel's   understanding of matter as fluctuating, interfering processes in the   lapse of time and the related concept of irreversible laws and relates   it to Ernst Mach's philosophy and to Richard Semon's theory of mneme.   Finally, it shows the practical consequences of the concept of   materialism in Edgar Zilsel's epistemology.

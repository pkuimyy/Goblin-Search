SO ISEGORIA
AB In this paper we explore the rise, during late francoism, of a   philosophical avantgard; it emerged introducing an open break with   everything resembling an academic ethos. The philosophical production of   Fernando Savater and Eugenio Trias, who are the most prominent figures   of this trend, are studied in an exhaustive way. We demonstrate the   presence of a total -in the case of Savater- or a partial break -in   Trias case- with academic philosophy, including the most modern   tendencies (Analytical Philosophy, Marxist criticism). In Savater's   trajectory the rupture is supported by the reading of Nietzsche provided   by the French thinkers belonging to the College de Sociologie (Bataille,   Klossowski), Cioran essays and the importation of Frankfurt Critical   Theory. In constrast, the strategy deployed by Trias consisted in a sort   of avant-garde transformation centered in the academic commentary of   canonical texts. Trias use the structuralist method in order to change   the traditional technique of text reading. The context of this processs   is limited by important shifts concerning the political, religious and   editorial fields. The methodological background of this research is   supported by Pierre Bourdieu sociology of intelectual fields (Fabiano,   Pinto, Boschetti), the sociology of philosophical networks and ritual   interactions chains (Randall Collins) and the microhistorical analysis   of "philosophical constellations" (Dieter Henrich)

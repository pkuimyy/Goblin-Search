TI Against the commodification of everything - Anti-consumerist cultural
SO CULTURAL STUDIES
AB Cultural studies is in a difficult position if it wants to find itself   on the side of democracy against neo-liberalism in this age of   ecological crisis. A great deal of the deconstructive,   anti-essentialist, post-humanist, post-modernist thinking of recent   decades has undermined the grounds upon which earlier generations   understood the commodification of the world to be distasteful. In the   absence of any normative conception of humanity, community, or nature,   why not succumb to the deterritorializing thrill which the marketization   of everything promises? The liberal defence of consumer culture which   characterized a whole genre of work in cultural studies is clearly   unable to answer this question, predicated as it is on a now wholly   anachronistic critique of mid-century discourses of austerity,   restraint, and patriarchal normativity.   This might seem to leave us with a choice of either reverting to the   prescriptive Marxism of pre-1960s cultural theory or accepting the job   offered to us by the neo-liberal university: of training smart,   reflexive, ironic hedonists to work and consume efficiently in the   knowledge economy. However, there is another way. An attentive and   nuanced reading of post-structuralist and post-Marxist philosophy, as   well as older resources for cultural theory, can provide the basis for a   democratic and anti-essentialist critique of consumerism as a normative   paradigm which erases difference and silences political discussion by   the violent imposition of particular modes of relationality (in   particular that of the customer/seller relationship) on every social   scene. It is from the perspective of a politics which tries to keep open   the possibility of other, multiple modes of relationality, rather than   one which wishes to impose a singular utopian blueprint on the future,   that cultural studies can play a useful role in critiquing the hegemony   of consumerism and competitive individualism without succumbing to the   temptations of too much socialist nostalgia.

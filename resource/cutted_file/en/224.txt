TI Cultural Initiation of Medical Doctors
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB Eighteen years experience of teaching medical anthropology at a   Hungarian medical school offers insight into the dynamics of   interference between the rationalist epistemological tradition of   biomedicine as one of the central paradigms of modernism and the   cultural relativism of medical anthropology, as cultural anthropology is   considered to be one of the generators of postmodern thinking. Tracing   back the informal "prehistory" of our Institute, we can reveal its   psychosomatic, humanistic commitment and critical basis as having   represented a kind of counterculture compared with the technocrats of   state-socialist Hungary's health ideology. The historical change and   socio-cultural transition in Hungary after 1989 was accompanied by   changes in the medical system as well as in philosophy and in the   structure of the teaching of social sciences. The developing pluralism   in the medical system together with the pluralism of social ideologies   allowed the substitution of the dogmatic Marxist-Leninist framework with   the more pragmatic and empiricist behavioral sciences including medical   sociology and medical anthropology. The conflict between the initiation   function of the hard preclinical training of the first two years, and   the reflective, relativistic and critical narrative on "biomedicine as   culture bound entity" constructed by medical anthropology during the   second year of medical training is discussed. We also submit our   fieldwork data gained as a result of a two year investigation period   focusing on diverse initiation types of "would be" physicians. The main   proportion of our data derives from individual semi structured deep   interviews together with focus group interviews carried out with medical   students of upper years. Finally, the role of medical anthropology in   the "rite of passage" of becoming a medical doctor is summarized, paying   attention to their field work reports and the risks and gains in this   process.

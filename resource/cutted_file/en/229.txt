TI The Logic-Debate in the Early Phase of the DDR-Philosophy, 1951-1958
SO DEUTSCHE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PHILOSOPHIE
AB The dispute over the interpretation of logic was one of the most   controversial issues in its time and characterized the emerging   philosophy of the young GDR. The East German philosophers aimed at   determining an acceptable understanding of Marxist logic linked to   classical Marxist-Leninism and the conceptions of logic deriving from   the German philosophy of idealism. But the official position of the SED   clashed with the views of the academics involved. At the end of the day   it was the independent academics with their interpretations who won   through. This benign outcome was unique in the history of GDR   philosophy.

SO STUDI IRLANDESI-A JOURNAL OF IRISH STUDIES
AB Peter J. Conradi, a lifelong friend and biographer of Iris Murdoch, born   in Dublin of Anglo-Irish parents, speaks of her attachment to/detachment   from her country of origin as follows: "Her Irish connection was   reflected in a lifetime's intellectual and emotional engagement [ that]   - before her illness - transformed her from a romantic Marxist idealist   to a hard-line Unionist and defender of the politics of Ian Paisley"   (Conradi 2001b). This article is an attempt to investigate possible   connections between Murdoch's social, ethnic, and religious background   and her philosophy based on up-rooted and rootedness and self-distancing   (terms borrowed from Simone Weil) personified in the characters of her   numerous novels. Her only works set in Ireland, namely the short story   "Something Special" (1958), and the novels The Unicorn (1963) and The   Red and the Green (1965), will be analysed and compared with the novels   of another womanwriter from the same background, Jennifer Johnston, the   doyen of Irish writers, who has inherited and modified the same   tradition in the light of contemporary Irish history.

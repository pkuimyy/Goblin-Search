TI Choice as a category of human activity - and some of its contextual
SO LINGUISTICS AND THE HUMAN SCIENCES
AB Choice has been built into Systemic Functional Linguistics from its   beginning. It has a specialized technical meaning in SFL not to be   equated with its sense in philosophical and sociological discourses.   However, many of these other senses of choice form cultural contexts for   the SFL-term, and some of these contexts will be addressed in an   exploration of their significance for acts of evaluation as a necessary   prerequisite for human agency.   We shall start by discussing unproblematized notions of the freedom of   choice of the autonomous individual as represented in a popular essay by   David Foster-Wallace (2012). These notions will be criticized in the   spirit of the critique of the notion of Subject2 by Foucault (1966), and   of sociological work by Bourdieu (1979) on habitus in modern societies,   both of which cull the notion of the autonomous individual very much   into question. We shall then turn to attempts to defend the notion of   the Subject and of choice by locating its roots in key elements of Greek   philosophy and their further development in both Christian and   post-enlightenment materialist and Marxist reasoning (Habermas, 2008).   For systemic linguistics, the notions of choice and of the value-systems   upon which choice needs to be based (Halliday, 2001) are crucial for   motivating the concepts of activity and social agency, so essential for   an integrated sociolinguistic theory (Hasan, 2009).

SO SOCIOLOGIA
AB The paper focuses descriptively and analytically on the   historiographical works of Alexander Hirner. The emphasis is on his   works from the history of sociology in Slovakia. The paper divides the   historiographical work of Alexander Hirner into three chronological   chapters and one analytical chapter. The first chapter deals with   Hirner's work in the 40s and, particularly, with his concept of the   autonomy of Slovak history that was inspired by philosophy of vitalism.   The second chapter aims at the description and the analytical evaluation   of that period contest with the official Marxist historiography, that   Hirner leaded in the 50s. Hirner did not agree with the Marxist   simplifying concept of history that reduced the history to the   monolinear change of social-economic formations. In contrary, Hirner   advocated a more complex and less ideological study of the history. The   third chapter mainly analyses Himer's crucial work from the domain of   the sociological history - the monograph "Czechoslovak Sociology till   the 1948", In this work, Hirner elaborated an original theoretical model   for the historiographical study of sociology that can be universally   applied as the basic framework for the analysis of the history of   sociology. The last chapter of the paper analyses Hirner's concept of   the meaning of the history. It suggests that Hirner perceived the   meaning and progress of history, first of all, in the gradual national   emancipation that should be interrelated with humanism, freedom and   democracy. In the history of sociology, he considers a continually   increasing unity of theory and empirical research to be the essential   indicator of its scientific progress.

TI Methodological implications of Marxist practical philosophy for
SO THEORY & PSYCHOLOGY
AB One of the traditional branches of Western practical philosophy, Marxist   practical philosophy, is still the mainstream philosophy in contemporary   China. It provides not only a new understanding of human nature, mind,   behavior, and environment, but also an alternative perspective for the   study of psychology. It is from this perspective that activity theory in   the former Soviet Union and "practice" discussions in China try to   integrate Marxist practical philosophy with psychology. Based on these   attempts, we advocate the introduction of "practice" into psychology and   the understanding of all psychological problems as starting from   "practice." First, "practice" is defined as people's creative activity   and a way of human existence. The structure of "practice" is then   divided into three hierarchies: reflexive practice, cognitive practice,   and social and cultural practice. Finally, two examples are chosen to   explain how to research psychology from the viewpoint of Marxist   practical philosophy.

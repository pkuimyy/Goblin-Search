TI Aspects of Writing and Politics in the Philosophy of Simone Weil
SO PENSAMIENTO Y CULTURA
AB The article looks at several aspects of the ethical and political   dimensions of Simone Weil's writing on her experience as a factory   worker in 1934-1935. It also attempts to follow the steps she would have   taken to rethink oppression in relation to the gestures, sounds, looks   and manifestations of the working condition. These two records are   intertwined in Weil's reflections on the plight of workers. Based on a   particular Marxist heritage, she problematizes oppression in a certain   materiality of both the discourse and the bodies that move about in the   scenario of the factory, a question that gives this thinking a relevant   specificity in a certain tendency in contemporary French philosophy.

SO JOURNAL OF WOMENS HISTORY
AB Remembered as the constant companion of Mexican artists Frida Kahlo and   Diego Rivera, the folksinger Concha Michel achieved notoriety for   providing the soundtrack of Mexico's cultural Left. However, she also   authored many Works of poetry and prose that critiqued liberal, Marxist,   and Catholic universalisms-all while maintaining a tireless pace as a   teacher and activist.

AU Lewis, William S.
TI Editorial introduction to Louis Althusser's 'Letter to the Central
SO HISTORICAL MATERIALISM-RESEARCH IN CRITICAL MARXIST THEORY
AB As an accompaniment to the translation into English of Louis Althusser's   'Letter to the Central Committee of the PCF, March I 8,h, 1966', this   note provides the historical and theoretical context necessary to   understand Althusser's 'anti-humanist' interventions into French   Communist Party policy decisions during the mid-1960s. Because nowhere   else in Althusser's published writings do we see as clearly the   political stakes involved in his philosophical project, nor the way in   which this project evolved from a 'theoreticist' pursuit into a more   practical one, the note also argues that the letter is of importance to   Althusser scholars, to historians of Marxist thought, and to those   interested in the relevance of Althusser's work to contemporary Marxist   philosophy.

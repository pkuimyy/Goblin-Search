TI Kant and the Dialectical Logic
SO HYBRIS-REVISTA DE FILOSOFIA
AB For determining the role of Kant's philosophy in the dialectical logic,   eight aspects of the Kant's contribution to its development are   proposed. Kant, when shows the intrinsically dialectical character of   the theoretical thought's synthetic activity, sets the starting point of   the dialectical modern logic as the epistemic philosophy in agreement   with the new natural sciences' worldview that he in self began. However,   by not taking these dialectical aspects until their last consequences,   the philosophy of Kant ended in the same beginning of the movement that,   for other thinkers' mediation, would arrive to the Marxist dialectical   logic.

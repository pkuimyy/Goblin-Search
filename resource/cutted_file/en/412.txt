AB While for Marxist-Leninists Marxian theory implies the concept of a   Centrally-Planned Economy (CPE) some western scholars hold that it would   be incorrect and injust to consider Marx as the theoretical predecessor   of a Soviet-type CPE. In contrast to these diverging views the article   stresses the necessity of a more differentiated approach to the   implications of Marxian analysis. On the one hand it is shown that   inspite of many ambiguities it would be doubtful to derive from the   economic analysis of Marx the concept of a CPE in a clear-cut way. On   the other hand Marxian economics are connected to his Historical   Materialism that has its origins in the philosophy of Hegel. It is shown   that this philosophical background of Marx is the reason of most   difficulties of understanding concerning Marx ideas of the breakdown of   capitalism and of the structures of a post-capitalist economic system.   It is shown that it is not in Marxian economics but in Marxian   philosophy of Hegelian origin that CPE implications can be found.

TI The speech of historians from the "signs of times": On the derivation of
SO ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SEMIOTIK
AB When one conceives of historical events as "signs of the times", one   connects the focus on the past with the focus on the future. This can be   achieved in several ways. From the view-point of Christianity, Idealist   philosophy, and Marxist ideology, the "signs of the times" presage a   state of humanity that is anticipated to be the final one; positivistic   approaches to history, on the other hand, follow the example of the   natural sciences in proceeding from antecedent conditions and using laws   of nature to derive predictions about the future course of things, while   the Enlightenment approach to history subjects historical prognosis to   moral maxims which are treated as valid a priori. In all these cases,   taking given events as "signs of the times" amounts to integrating them   into a well-established knowledge system which serves to define   pre-conceived human conditions for the coming stages of human history.

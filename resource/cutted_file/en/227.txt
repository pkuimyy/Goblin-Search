TI Gramsci and Games
SO GAMES AND CULTURE
AB The objective of this article is to highlight the relevance ideological   debate plays in the study of popular culture texts and in particular in   that of video games. Every text is a reflection of the ideological   forces (cultural, economic, social, individual, etc.) generating it.   Thus, ideology is essentially an omnipresent entity, which knows no   boundaries of class, race, or cultural background. As a matter of fact,   games are capable of reflecting ideological stances in a variety of   ways. Throughout the first part of this article, we will revisit   ideology from a Marxist perspective, that is, as a form of deception,   manipulation, and enslavement and subsequently by moving away from such   a deterministic/fatalistic approach and discussing it in the light of   Gramsci's theory of hegemony. By providing practical examples, this   article will attempt to show how both ideological and hegemonic   processes operate in the video game medium.

AB This paper considers the trajectory of Althusser's Spinozism pre- and   post-May 68. Where Althusser's application of Spinoza would often lead   him into unknown or non-Marxist territory, one alternative way to think   this relation is through the figure of Mao, whose concept of   non-antagonistic contradiction I propose to read in terms of Spinoza's   determinate negation. Although not going so far as to suggest that a   certain combination of Mao and Spinoza would have enabled Althusser to   complete Marx, this paper speculates on this omission from his work and   what positive insights we can draw from it retrospectively for   developing Althusser's political philosophy.

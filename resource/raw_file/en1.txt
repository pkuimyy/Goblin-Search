AB The objective of this paper is to defend the importance of ontological
   critique of the mainstream economics. To do so, we examine the
   methodological arguments of Tony Lawson who, inspired by the critical
   realism philosophy, advocates in favor of realistic, non-deductive and
   ontology-aware economics to solve problems of contemporary economic
   theory. This article proposes that, although correct in the logic of its
   argument, Lawson's critique of the mainstream is not able to explain the
   social reasons for its existence and reproduction. And if so, Lawson's
   critique is not ontological. It can be stated that a project of
   generally reorienting economics methodology is impossible in case the
   social reason for its orthodox existence is maintained. Some substantial
   insights can be found in the Marx's ontological critique of capitalism
   and also in the Critical Realism philosophy. Therefore, we propose an
   explanation for the enduring deductivism and empirical realism in
   economics from a Marxist perspective.

AB This is a review of the book: Sheehan H. Marxism and the Philosophy of
   Science. A Critical History. The First Hundred Years. (L.: Verso, 2017.
   XII. 450 p.). The keynote of the book serves the conviction that Marxism
   is a sort of "super-theory" that can explain not only any social and
   political life, but also profound philosophy of science, including
   natural science. Science is presented in the book as a form of social
   practice. The main idea of the Marxist philosophy of science is the
   status of the theory of dialectical materialism. The author shows that
   Marxist ideas could be considered as the origins of many disciplines:
   the sociology of science, the history of science, the history of
   technology; they had a noticeable effect on non-Marxist thought as well.
   However, Stalinism and Lysenkoism significantly decelerated the
   development of the Marxist philosophy of science.

   of utopia. It wants to show and to recover the characteristic way in
   which this tradition confronts the question of utopia. In my
   explanation, Ellacuria's thoughts play a special role, because of his
   explicit claim to utopia as ideal, within the framework of a philosophy
   being very close to Hegelian Marxism. This makes it possible to show the
   peculiarity of Ellacuria's position and, at the same time, the plurality
   of positions facing the problem of utopia inside the tradition of

AB Marxist tradition as a social philosophy has sought to locate
   emancipation in the person of the working class or various other
   sub-state actors. However, it has been obvious for long that the
   metahistorical agency entrusted with those forces is less than viable.
   Offering an alternative perspective to the question of the agent of
   emancipatory action, the present research attempts to situate the
   potential of emancipatory praxis in international relations with the
   state acting as the primary actor for dialectical change. It holds that,
   if a radical shift from the contemporary conditions of economic and
   political subjugation to respect for sovereignty, inclusive development
   and peaceful coexistence is to be realized, the direction of
   emancipatory flow must be from international to national. Thus, through
   a re-contextualization of emancipation at the interstate level of
   analysis, this study proposes a thorough evaluation of China's
   conceptualization of international governance against the backdrop of
   its ongoing material and ideational emergence.

AB This review analyzes the six related essays that comprise Vittorio
   Morfino's book Plural Temporality: Transindividuality and the Aleatory
   between Spinoza and Althusser, each of which involve key points of
   intervention and related philosophical debates regarding the references
   to Spinoza that comprised Althusser's constant labor in Marxist theory.
   Reconstructing some of the crucial arguments and their implications, I
   show that Morfino synthesizes these elements scattered throughout
   Althusser in a productive and rigorous historical recapitulation that
   results in new insights for an ontology of relations and the theory of
   temporality which must be constructed out of its demands. While the
   points of departure often revolve around Athusserian philosophy,
   Morfino's endeavor constitutes its own extensive intervention into the
   current theoretical conjuncture, and stands up as an important
   touchstone for contemporary work in Althusserian philosophy, Spinoza's
   Marxism, and Marxist theory more broadly.

AB How can Marx's ideas help us with the problem of how to make new
   revolutionary beginnings in a time when the counterrevolution is
   ascendant, without losing sight of the need to prepare for the equally
   crucial question of what happens after the revolution? Capitalism has
   taken various forms as it developed, with the latest shaped by its
   endemic crisis since the mid-1970s generated by its falling rate of
   profit. Throughout these stages, the humanism and dialectic of Capital
   remain prime determinants of allowing Marxist responses not to stop at
   economic analyses but to release, rather than inhibiting, new
   revolutionary subjects and directions. Critical for the present moment
   is to take up Marx's humanism and dialectic as crucial dimensions of his
   philosophy of revolution in permanence. This encompasses not alone the
   famous March 1850 Address to the Communist League, but also the full
   trajectory of Marx's revolutionary life and thought from the 1844
   Economic-Philosophic Manuscripts through Capital to the new moments of
   Marx's last decade as expressed in his writings on Russia and his
   Ethnological Notebooks. We trace Marx's theoretical/ philosophical
   concept of permanent revolution in a number of his writings, to confront
   how various post-Marx Marxists addressed or ignored this dimension of
   Marx's thought, and explore whether this concept can be seen as central
   to Marx's body of thought, and can assist in the dual task of needed
   revolutionary transformation-the destruction of the old ( negation) and
   the construction of the new ( the negation of the negation).

AB This study focuses on a particular distinctive moment in the Czech and
   French history of literary thinking which took place in the latter half
   of the 1960s and which saw not only an encounter of Marxism and
   structuralism, but also a shift and radical change in the conception of
   literary structure. Marxist philosopher and historian Robert
   Kalivodapresents the development of Jan Mukarovsky's structural literary
   aesthetics from a Marxist and Freudian perspective; according to him,
   Mukarovsky's conception matured in association with the production and
   reflection of the interwar artistic avant-garde (Karel Teige) towards a
   conception of aesthetic function and value as transparent anthropic
   principles and work of art as a dynamic ensemble of extra-aesthetic
   functions and values. Simultaneously, the representative of French
   Althusserian Marxism Pierre Macherey formulates his conception of
   literary output as a specific mode in the production of speech and
   literary structure as a space of difference, in which the ideological
   universalizations of the period are unconsciously presented in a
   critical light. Within the Czech structuralist tradition and in harmony
   with its avant-garde pedigree - a parallel conception then emerges
   within the works of Oleg Sus and Milan Jankovic of literary structure as
   a structure that is unconsolidated and unconsolidatable, as the process
   and action of meaning, the movement of contradictions that will not have
   culminated in a final and completed synthesis. Analysis of the internal
   contexts and interrelations of these conceptions leads us to interpret
   them as the movement of concurrent - misses a radical change in the
   structure and the opening of its dialectics here has different
   resonances, caused by a different conception of the subject and the
   relationship between the work and the social structure and also a failed
   meeting, whose connections have for the most part hitherto escaped the
   attention of literary studies and philosphy historians.

AB The article starts out with a question: is acceleration, proposed as a
   strategy by the accelerationist hypothesis, not only a necessary but
   also a sufficient condition for the ultimate and unalterable destruction
   of capitalist order? The author is quick to respond in the negative,
   arguing that catastrophism per se is already written in this order-and
   even constitutes the ground of its power. In turn, the deduction of the
   accelerationist hypothesis from the works of Deleuze and Guattari (which
   is commonly performed by both its champions and opponents) has its own
   limitations. In "What is Philosophy?", Deleuze and Guattari move away
   from the irrevocable value of acceleration (as a revolutionary
   methodology) in favour of the determination of stability in the midst of
   chaos. In that work, they emphasize the relation between chaos and the
   brain, leading the author to suggest that the bodily point of view is
   crucial, not only for a discussion of occasional ruptures in the works
   of Deleuze and Guattari, but also for any discussion of the
   "accelerating machine."
   From the perspective of sensibility, chaos acts as the pathological
   perception of speed. Acceleration itself becomes a function which leads
   to the dysfunction of the whole system of the body-to a panic which
   appears as an inversion of the paranoia of capitalist order. The author
   notes that there is some conceptual proximity between the concept of
   general intellect (from Marx of the "Grundrisse" era to Autonomist
   Marxist Paolo Virno) and the accelerationist hypothesis. However, seeing
   that the latter mistakes liberating potentiality (latent in the present
   composition of work and technology) for almost logical necessity, he
   perceives the proximity between them to be very dangerous.

   understand the specific nature of the historical situation of the
   colonised peoples. Moreover, in many cases the Marxist philosophy of
   history led to an explicit justification of colonial violence, viewed as
   a painful but necessary evil in order to give rise to a subsequent

   try to consider the moment in the life of each theory in which Spinoza
   appeared, what theoretical problems led, in each case, to a conceptual
   encounter with the thought of the Dutch philosopher and, in this sense,
   what aspects of Spinoza's philosophy were taken up again. In Althusser's
   case, the emphasis will be on Spinoza as an antidote against all
   teleology and as the bearer of a materialistic conception of the
   imagination; in the case of Rozitchner, Spinoza is present insofar as he
   illuminates a deep rationality associated with the affective life of
   men. In this way we will try to compare the constitution of two very
   different paths, in order to account for the complexity and richness
   that Spinoza's thinking acquires in the light of the problems opened up

   traditional work of art, the romantics, in the figure of F. Schlegel and
   Novalis, point to the continuation of a philosophical art discourse that
   ignores the traditional presuppositions, using concepts such as immanent
   criticism and medium-of-reflection. Based on that, this article seeks to
   show how this double heritage remains throughout the main works of
   Benjamin, especially the "German Tragic Drama" and the work of the
   "Passages", at the center of which is the concept of montage. Finally,
   resorting to Marxist influence, the text outlines some political
   consequences of this art criticism that, developed from youth, remains

AB Four approaches to the globalization problem exists in Latin American
   global studies: apologetical, institutional, objectivist and critical,
   while two last of them are dominating. The apologetical one is
   represented by minority. Within the institutional approach,
   globalization appears as a function of transnational institutes'
   activities, is understood as a process controlled and organized by
   international financial and economic authorities. The objectivist
   approach assumes the attitude on globalization as a fundamental
   objective process - specifically as an asymmetric process in some sort,
   a theoretical "echo" of the dependent development theory, or
   "dependentism", once popular in Latin America, highlighting a structural
   division of the world capitalism system into center and periphery. In
   the Latin American authors' theoretical discourse, great attention is
   paid to political aspects and consequences of globalization. In
   particular, there are many fears and cautions before an eventual
   dilution of state institutes as part of this spontaneous process. Within
   the critical approach, the key concept is "neoliberal globalization". In
   the most explicit way, this approach is carried out by authors belonging
   to the Cuban school of Latin American global studies. The Cuban
   scientists use the "transnationalization" term as a synonym of
   "globalization". The most radical variety of the Marxist interpretation
   of globalization assumes its understanding as the highest and last phase
   of imperialism. A considerable part of Latin American authors
   investigates an alternative searching of globalization perspectives. In
   this regard, it is possible to single out three directions -
   sociocultural, ethical and integrational. The sociocultural direction is
   concentrated on the Latin American identity theoretical search. The
   ethical direction continues the Latin American "liberation philosophy"
   tradition. In the politological aspect, the integrational direction is
   elaborated the most. A common denominator of these theoretical views is
   the idea that the interstate regional integration of Latin America alone
   will be able to amortize risks and minimize dangers connected to
   globalization. It is viewed as a peculiar protective barrier against the
   impact of multinational corporations and supranational global control
   institutes related to them, both seen in Latin America as new forms of
   the U.S. imperial domination. Specific for this approach is its
   reference to the real international integration practice, closely
   connected to the "left turn" phenomenon. Since the beginning of the 21st
   century, the new integration architecture has been built in the region,
   targeting at the state national sovereignty protection. Summing up, the
   author proposes the following hypothesis: in the medium term, a "second
   round" of the international discussion on the "globalization" conceptual
   contents is quite possible as a result of large political and economic
   shifts on the international scene.

AB In this article I analyze Zygmunt Bauman's oeuvre on consumerist
   culture, from the Polish (1953-1968) and English (1968-2017) stages of
   his scholarly career. I demonstrate that despite the passage of many
   years and the numerous changes in the way Bauman approached sociology,
   it is possible to see considerable overlap between the interpretations
   that he advanced in the two periods of his career. In the first part of
   the article I focus on how Bauman's observations-dating back to the
   sixties and relating to the theory of culture, Marxist theory, and the
   method of ideal types-found their reflection in what he called the
   "consumerist syndrome" (seen as a set of properties permeating all
   planes of social life). In the second part of the article I highlight
   the fact that his observations were inspired by a model of critical
   sociology that evolved from Antonio Gramsci's "philosophy of praxis" and
   utopian thinking of an iconoclastic nature. And even though my analysis
   focuses on the denotative and conative dimensions of Bauman's vision of
   consumerist culture, I also present more general conclusions regarding
   the continuity and variability of his entire sixty-plus years of
   scholarly activity. The article offers an opportunity for
   English-speaking readers to become familiar with Bauman's Polish
   writings and should encourage further research in this area.

AB The paper focuses on the situation in Russian philosophy at the
   beginning of the 20th century. Of special interest is the discussion
   between the so called "critical positivism" and the "new idealism". The
   former is represented by A. A. Bogdanov, P.S. Juskevic, V. A. Bazarov
   and Ja. A. Berman; the latter is represented by N. A. Berdjaev, S. N.
   Bulgakov, P. A. Florenskij and others. In a first step, I reconstruct
   this discussion on the basis of the collected works "Problems of
   idealism" (1902) and "Landmarks" (1909) from the side of the idealists,
   and "Essays of realist world view" (1904), "Essays on Marxist
   Philosophy" (1908), and "Essays on philosophy of collectivism" (1909)
   published by the positivists. I argue that this discussion took on the
   character of the struggle of worldviews: it was a struggle of the
   traditional Russian paradigm of philosophical thinking against the new
   type of philosophizing which was oriented towards the natural sciences.
   After that, I briefly characterize the theoretical and practical
   programs of "critical positivism". Its main theoretical principle is
   "realism", and its core practical principle is "idealism". However, both
   the concept of "realism" and the concept of "idealism" received a
   completely new interpretation. Bogdanov's "empiriomonism", Juskevic's
   "empiriosymbolism" and Bazarov's philosophy, which developed the ideas
   of empiriocritiscism, can be seen as different modifications of the
   realizing these key principles. I promote the view that we can consider
   the so called "third" wave of Russian positivism (Bogdanov, Juskevic,
   Bazarov) as "neopositivism", because, within this currency, the
   transformation from scientific philosophy to theory of science took
   place. The vivid illustration of this transformation can be seen in
   Bogdanov's general theory of organization or "Tectology".

AB The article is devoted to the problem of "Marxist fragments" in the
   later works of A.F. Losev and especially in the "History of ancient
   aesthetics". Several provisions are refuted in the article: 1) what A.F.
   Losev, after the 1930s, moved to the position of Marxism; 2) what
   "Marxist fragments" are no more than mimicry in order to deceive the
   censorship; 3) that Losev was compelled to write like a Marxist taking
   into account a censorship and without going further statement of
   relative truth contained in Marxism.
   The author examines the concept of the formation which is used by
   Marxists, as well as by Losev and by the example of this concept proves
   that Losev developed his own theory of formations based on Platonism and
   the philosophy of Absolute unity. Losev's theory of formations is not
   the historical idealism as well as not the historical materialism, for
   he interprets society as holistic structure model without primary and
   secondary components. In this model any dimension of society
   (production, culture, politics) does not directly affect another but
   repeats it in methodical and structural sense.

   thesis of our book - that contemporary philosophy has a blind spot
   concerning the philosophical priors of its status as an institution.
   That is, 20th and now 21st century philosophy has limited metaphilosophy
   to being an exclusively theoretical exercise, neglecting to also pursue
   a philosophy of philosophy' in its material, bureaucratic, and Marxist
   dimensions. After making these points in the introduction, the article
   is divided into three parts that deal, in turn, with comments that are
   facile, earnest, and provocative. We then conclude by noting the
   unintentional irony of our contemporary situation, where the vast
   majority of philosophy departments are inhabited by sophists rather than

AB In response to the contemporary American philosopher Michael J. Sandel's
   tremendous popularity and ongoing engagements with Chinese philosophy,
   which are often offered as evidence of a deep resonance between his work
   and contemporary Chinese interests in justice, I argue that his
   conception of justice as a product of the storyteller's narrative quest
   encounters two potential problems when considered from a Chinese
   perspective. The first is whether "Chinese" justice-which can be viewed
   substantially as a collective if not individual attempt to overcome
   subalternity as the Oriental subject-can be achieved through the foreign
   forms of moral reasoning that are perhaps guilty of consigning Chinese
   to their status as Orientals in the first place. The second questions
   whether the Western culture of storytelling, of the heroic subject who
   conquers the other (so often the Oriental in modern times), is not
   already a product and producer of injustice, and in its contemporary
   forms, a fantasy and fetish of capitalist society that is not only
   incapable of individual justice, but also complicit in injustices
   towards others. These points are raised in tandem with discussions of
   ongoing generational shifts in China largely attributable to the rapid
   expansion of a market economy and the growing normalization of
   Western-style heroic, justice seeking storyteller, which might in turn
   legitimize Sandel's approach to justice. However, from a Marxist
   perspective, I argue that such developments might be Trojan horses for
   new forms of subjugation, alienation, and inauthentic being-in short,
   contra Western Orientalist universalism, the very injustices that
   China's modernity project has aimed to overcome and with which it risks
   assimilation.

AB The essay seeks to set the framework by which we may appraise the
   efficacy of the salvaging strategies employed by Muriel Rukeyser's
   poetic response to the Hawk's Nest Tunnel Disaster in West Virginia in
   her collection, The Book of the Dead (1938). In seeking to reclaim the
   lost experiences and objects of exploited miners, Rukeyser's project to
   salvage their anonymous suffering at the hands of capitalist greed
   places her as an artist within the historical materialist tradition
   outlined in Walter Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History
   (1942). The Book of the Dead explores the legacy of European
   capitalism's displacement of the Native-American Asiatic' society as
   delineated by Marx in the Grundrisse (1939). It is argued that Rukeyser
   aims to salvage the signs and materials of industrial conflict, such as
   the insurrectionary figure of John Brown, in order to begin to create
   the always-unfinished symbol' against the misappropriating machinations
   of capitalism, continuing the work of poets such as Herman Melville. The
   essay argues that Rukeyser's symbolic framework which aims to spur the
   subjective worker to action through imagination invokes a 'Hydraulic
   state', as in ancient Egypt, inspiring a quasi-religious submission to
   the higher unity of the hydroelectric dam and those who died creating
   it. Finally, we explore the implications where this spur to collective
   working-class action depends upon the consciousness of the human
   conduit: the irony at the heart of Marxist autonomy.

AB The teachers education in the current universe of technologies and the
   need to obtain students capable of thinking and thinking for themselves
   has been a constant challenge and difficult to overcome for many
   teachers at all levels of education. The competition of the school with
   the media, if on one hand helps the students life; On the other hand, it
   puts them away from the possibility of deeper researches, from contact
   with a physical library, since the superficiality of the themes offered
   by the Internet often assumes this role, making difficult to develop
   logical reasoning and their own capacity to write with clarity, cohesion
   and creativity. But how can we produce quality texts if the student is
   not trained to exercise the dialectic and does not have content to do
   them so? The researches which have been developed by us over the last
   twenty years, based on the concern with the quality of teaching, are
   based in particular on the teacher's ability to lead the student to
   reflection, creating a cognitive network that is not directly linked to
   dogmatic teaching, which is capable to reduce their vision. The
   educational reform recently proposed by the government proposes a school
   without indoctrination, however, many teachers feel incapable of finding
   a way to help their students to be more critical and observant, since
   many History, Geography or even Philosophy manuals present a clearly
   Marxist tendency. How to lead the student to reflection, without being
   led by doctrinal paths? How to get him to reflect on the problems in
   which he lives in, in order to distinguish a rational thought from a
   biased one, if the world around him, the media, especially the internet,
   provides him with clearly doctrinal bases? In this article we will try
   to present ways that either was useful for the formation of Pedagogy
   teachers or in the work with high school students, aiming the
   development of their capacity for reflection. Based on Psychology
   (BETTELHEIM, 1980; JUNG, 2008) in the Philosophy of Education (LIPMAN,
   1994), in the anthropology (ELIADE, 1972; CAMPBELL, 2013) and in the
   Classical Philosophy (PENHA, 1994), we will present our approach to
   training critical and questioning students.

AB If You're an Egalitarian, How Come You're So Rich? presents Gerald A.
   (Jerry) Cohen's musings on his ethnic identity. The interplay between
   the personal reflections, central to which is Cohen's communist Jewish
   upbringing in Montreal, and the philosophical position that Cohen holds,
   sheds Canadian light on the foundations of Western culture. Although he
   identified as Jewish throughout his life, Judaism Cohen rejected. Too,
   as a Marxist early, a luck egalitarian later, he was critical of the
   liberalism that Jewish people (certainly those of his native Montreal)
   embrace. Most Jewish Canadians self-classify as secular Jews. Cohen is
   right to waver, but not because, as he incorrectly avers, being a Jew is
   in tension with irreligiosity. Cohen does not qualify as a secular Jew
   because he does not qualify as a Jew at all. His philosophy disqualifies
   him. What is it to be a Jew? The Hebrew Bible contains the answer.
   Against the then-regnant, pagan, belief system, the Bible advances a
   conception of a person as an effective locus of action within the system
   that is nature. This conception is the essence of humanism. In effect,
   being a Jew is an ethnically inflected form of being, in the dominant
   Western sense, a person. As distinct from adhering to Judaism, or being
   Jewish, being a Jew associates more than just voluntarily with
   liberalism. The religion-friendly irreligiosity of the secular Jews of
   Montreal turns out, then, to link with a value embedded deep in Canadian
   political life. Cohen's philosophical anthropology, enmeshing men and
   women in a wider whole, socio-economic (Marxism) or natural (luck
   egalitarianism), marks him as a neo-pagan. As to Cohen's Jewishness,
   even a pagan can eat bagels and speak Yiddish.

AB Although Frantz Fanon's work has been widely read and discussed in
   recent years, his contributions are often abstracted from its debt to
   Marxist theory and Hegelian philosophy. This paper seeks to correct this
   by re-examining his approach to issues of recognition, identity, and
   self-consciousness in Black Skin, White Masks in light of contemporary
   issues of racism and ethnic identity. Fanon departs from Hegel in many
   respects, especially concerning his understanding of the nature of the
   'master/slave' relations that are structured along racial lines. He also
   seeks to go beyond Marx by providing a psycho-affective as against a
   primarily economic analysis of exploitation and alienation. Instead of
   representing a departure of the dialectical tradition, however, Fanon's
   insights on these and other issues represent a crucial extension and
   concretization of it in light of the realities of his lived experience.

   Henry's lead, I seek to find the philosophical moral of the story' of
   Voices Under the Window, the 1955 first novel of the late Jamaican
   writer John Hearne (1926-94), which some critics regard as his best
   work. In a novel with significant autobiographical elements, Hearne, a
   high-brown' or red' Jamaican, recounts the story of Mark Lattimer,
   likewise a red man' positioned at the upper edge of the brown' stratum
   of the white/brown/black Jamaican social pyramid. Lattimer moves from a
   race-denying attempt to pass' in World War II Britain to a Marxist
   social activism upon his later return to post-war Jamaica, but is killed
   in a black protest riot. His tragic fate raises important philosophical
   questions about race, colour, class, and personal and social
   transformation that remain very relevant today, especially considering
   the failure of 1970s Anglo-Caribbean radicalism to fulfil its
   revolutionary promise.

   example, the question of the classics is pointed out by Saviani as a
   reference for the selection of school subjects. The category of freedom
   is understood following the marxist tradition in a way opposed to the
   liberal-bourgeois point of view based on the historical analysis of the
   construction of sociability and culture using work as foundation. This
   historical perspective gives meaning to the ideas proposed by Saviani
   regarding knowledge, human education and school curriculum.

AB In Peter McLaren's words We need a philosophically grounded alternative
   to capitalism, but what does such a philosophical grounding look like?
   Need it be shared? The philosophical basis for practice was not shared
   by Lenin and Bogdanov, for example, and yet both retained the ability to
   work together in the Bolshevik party. There's a profound difference
   between god-building, and god-seeking. Socialists have strong traditions
   of both. Peter McLaren's recent work fits into the latter category. I
   will engage with this project, because I think Peter's position, whilst
   honourable, lacks the visionary power of the former. And to these I
   would like to add a third position, one which seeks to extend to all of
   the material universe and to all living things a sacred character, but
   without any requirement for categories such as god. There are of course
   many mystic traditions which espouse something similar, but relatively
   few socialists have developed politically this position, as espoused by
   the tanner-philosopher Josef Dietzgen (though there are certainly close
   links between Dietzgenism and god-building). My argument for raising
   such seemingly arcane concerns, is rather similar to that of Lenin whose
   immersion in philosophy in writing Materialism and Empirio-Criticism
   primarily met the political requirements of the day. Amidst ubiquitous
   talk of the Anthropocene, and a sudden rise in interest in Bogdanov on

AB Pieter Lemmens' neo-Marxist approach to technology urges us to rethink
   how to do political philosophy of technology. First, Lemmens' high level
   of abstraction raises the question of how empirically informed a
   political theory of technology needs to be. Second, his dialectical
   focus on a "struggle" between humans and technologies reveals the limits
   of neo-Marxism. Political philosophy of technology needs to return "to
   the things themselves". The political significance of technologies
   cannot be reduced to its origins in systems of production or social
   organization, but requires study at the micro-level, where technologies
   help to shape engagement, interaction, power, and social awareness.

AB The spatial turn' in education policy studies fuelled interest in
   Lefebvre's work: initially, in his work Production of Space and, more
   recently, Rhythmanalysis and Right to the City. Yet, although in these
   texts Lefebvre critiques universities and schools and introduces
   original pedagogical concepts, their educational strands have attracted
   little attention. Lefebvre's other works available in English have been
   largely overlooked in education literature. As France's first Professor
   of Sociology, Lefebvre was passionately engaged with education: in
   particular, teaching, competing for government grants and leading
   student activism. Critiques of education are threaded through Lefebvre's
   three-volume Critique of Everyday Life, his writings on architecture and
   anthologies. Lefebvre's work, The Explosion, is surprisingly neglected.
   A critique of French universities, it analyses student protests across
   Paris in 1968 - events in which Lefebvre was a leading activist. In
   geography and philosophy there are burgeoning secondary literatures on
   Lefebvre. Laying groundwork for such a literature in education, I survey
   Lefebvre's references to education in all the works available in
   English. Arguing that Lefebvre was an educational thinker in his own
   right, this paper sketches a roadmap' for educational readings of
   Lefebvre's prolific and largely sociological writing. This paper falls
   into three parts. The first uncovers core Marxist and phenomenological
   foundations of Lefebvre's critiques of universities and schools.
   Building on these, it introduces Lefebvre's pedagogical concepts. The
   second part contextualises these in relation to New' (or Progressive')
   education movements at critical moments' of 20th-century history. It
   includes a case study of one such moment - the 1968 Parisian student
   uprising - then outlines Lefebvre's summation of education in the late
   20th century. The third part draws together four Lefebvrian' pedagogical
   principles and considers their relevance today. Educational readings of
   Lefebvre, I suggest, can help educationists identify cracks or
   interstices' in technocratic rationality', suggesting strategies for
   resisting contemporary neo-liberal regimes.

AB The essay suggests that, during the last decades, the prevailing

   radicality, both of politics and of philosophy. The fall of the Berlin
   Wall has fueled many irenic illusions. However, beside the normativist
   ingenuities concerning the world government and the human rights
   religion (that have been cynically instrumentalized in order to justify
   wars-not-wars), what actually prevailed was a form of capitalistic
   absolutism that has forgotten the lesson of political realism.
   Neoliberal hegemony conquered the monopoly of the idea of freedom and
   distorted it, while globalism interlaced the contradictory beliefs of
   the Marxist vulgate. A wrong-headed hostility against the State has
   brought to a devaluation of democratic sovereignty and social rights,
   thus colluding with the neoliberal depoliticization.

AB Anton Pannekoek (1873-60) was both an influential Marxist and an
   innovative astronomer. This paper will analyze the various innovative
   methods that he developed to represent the visual aspect of the Milky
   Way and the statistical distribution of stars in the galaxy through a
   framework of epistemic virtues. Doing so will not only emphasize the
   unique aspects of his astronomical research, but also reveal its
   connections to his left radical brand of Marxism. A crucial feature of
   Pannekoek's astronomical method was the active role ascribed to
   astronomers. They were expected to use their intuitive ability to
   organize data according to the appearance of the Milky Way, even as they
   had to avoid the influence of personal experience and theoretical
   presuppositions about the shape of the system. With this method,
   Pannekoek produced results that went against the Kapteyn Universe and
   instead made him the first astronomer in the Netherlands to find
   supporting evidence for Harlow Shapley's extended galaxy. After
   exploring Pannekoek's Marxist philosophy, it is argued that both his
   astronomical method and his interpretation of historical materialism can
   be seen as strategies developed to make optical use of his particular
   conception of the human mind.

AB Geidar Dzhemal was arguably the best-known mouthpiece of radical Islam
   in the contemporary Russia media world: with his broad erudition in
   Western philosophy, Abrahamic theology and world history, he easily
   upstaged most official representatives of Islam in the country. While
   his Islamic project borrowed heavily from Marxist thinking, Dzhemal's
   non-conformist teaching and his personal charisma also made him famous
   among right-wing thinkers, who see him as the Godfather' of Russian
   converts to Islam. However, Dzhemal defied common classifications, both
   political and religious; his discourse adapted to the changes in Russian
   politics from Yeltsin to Putin, which allowed him to appeal to a broad
   range of audiences. This article argues that his popularity can be
   explained by the fact that, with his promotion of a global anti-Western
   revolution under the Islamic banner, Dzhemal was still embedded in
   mainstream discourses on Russia's national interests.

   class relations not only foregrounds the eminently open and contested
   nature of technology but also renders into view the multiplicity of
   actors and agencies involved in the making of natures. I draw from a
   subterranean strand of Marxist theorists of technology to develop a
   more-than-human approach to political agency through an interrogation of
   the complex interactions between human and machine in the everyday,
   experiential practicalities of the labor process. On this basis, the
   article contends that foregrounding the class preconditions for an

   reception of Hegelianism through the lenses of Kojeve and Wahl, the
   Marxist critique of capitalism and the rise of European fascism)
   Klossowski develops a peculiar interest in the works of Johann Georg
   Hamann, who can be considered to be either the first post-Kantian or the
   direct antecedent of post-Kantianism (given the fact that he influenced
   both Kant and many post-Kantians). As this paper argues, Klossowski
   published a collection of texts by Hamann as a direct response to the
   philosophical deadlock between conceptuality and immediate life that the
   French reception of Hegel emphasized.

AB This article rethinks the concept of the political from a posthumanist
   rather than a humanist vantage point. More specifically, it engages in
   an extended discussion of Wendy Brown's Undoing the Demos and its claims
   regarding the relationship between neoliberalism and the economic and
   political spheres, as exemplified in Michel Foucault's lectures, The
   Birth of Biopolitics. While sympathetic with Brown's views on the
   deleterious effects of neoliberalism, it takes issue with her critique
   of Foucault's "notorious late-1970s antagonism to Marxism" and its
   effects on his understanding of the relationship between the political
   and the economic, as reflected in the phenomenon of neoliberalism. This
   article argues instead that Foucault's work in The Birth of Biopolitics
   does indeed have an - important - genealogical relationship to Marxism,
   but it is not the humanist Marxism that frames Brown's analysis. What
   motivates Foucault's interest in neoliberalism is not his insufficiently
   Marxist understanding of the relationship between the economic and the
   political, but rather his larger - project of exploring a theory of
   social - complexity in which the economic does not and cannot
   unilaterally steer the other social systems, including the - political.
   This understanding is utterly consonant with Foucault's larger
   discussion of the qualitative shift from disciplinarity to
   governmentality, and evinces a genealogical through-line from
   Althusser's analysis of structural causality to Foucault's The Birth of
   Biopolitics, to Luhmann's social systems theory-one that fundamentally
   changes how we must think the concept of the political within a new
   understanding of social complexity.

AB Ideology has a theoretical concept, is not usually associated to the
   semiotic tradition, but rather to the fields of Philosophy and
   Socio-politics. The urge throughout the 70's to construct the concept as
   a sense producing mechanism reveal two antagonistic influences: that of
   the post-war Marxist debate; and that of the new cultural industry of
   which social-sciences have for task to describe and analyse. Eco
   introduced the word Ideology as a concept in the third part of Trattato
   (TSG) in the section Teoria della Produzione Signica within the frame of
   what he defined has "the superior limit of semiotics". The fact that
   Ideology can be considered as a system of representation for a social
   class, turned into an hegemonic system of comprehension and
   representation - in this sense Althusser and Gramsci provide us with
   prime definitions - raises many questions for semioticians. Against this
   backdrop our reflexion will seek to contrast the different semiotic
   conceptions on Ideology with the originality of Eco's approach. Then the

EP 225
PD 2017

AB The article aims to explain the connection of Marcuse's concept of
   dehistorization with his interpretation and criticism of the
   Heideggerian concept of historicity. Dehistorization in Marcuse's
   philosophy, according to my tentative definition, is the kind of
   transformation of the creative social forces and human abilities denying
   an existing reality that makes them elements of the mechanism producing
   and reproducing the existent reality, and thereby makes them a manner of
   repression of the human striving for freedom and happiness and a way to
   perpetuate domination. According to Marcuse, dehistorization is the main
   form of reproduction of the false totality. The idea of dehistorization
   is the prevailing critical concept in Marcuse's philosophy. It appears
   in the course of his criticism of fascism. The basis of the formation of
   the dehistorization concept is Marcuse's criticism and interpretation of
   Heidegger's conception of historicity during his "Heideggerian Marxism"
   period (1928-1933). This Heideggerian conception is the ultimate
   achievement of contemporary philosophy. The ultimate character of this
   achievement is given to it, according to Marcuse, that it treats history
   from the viewpoint of being in contrast to Hegel's idealistic dialectics
   and German historicism of the 19th century, which interpreted it from
   the viewpoint of consciousness or the spirit. There are four main
   tendencies in Marcuse's criticism and transformation of Heidegger's
   conception of historicity. 1. The deformalization of Heidegger's
   treatment of historicity of Dasein. The explanation of the material
   substance of historicity, i.e. the explanation of the material character
   of conditions of human existence (Dasein) as the definitive feature of
   historicity. 2. The concretization of Dasein, its treatment not as an
   individual, but as a class in view of substantial differences of the
   environment (Umwelt), material conditions of its existence. 3. Following
   from both the deformalization of historicity and the concretization of
   Dasein - the rehabilitation of the "being-with" (Mitsein) and the public
   sphere (Mitwelt), and, thereby, of the space of political struggle as
   the sphere of authenticity. 4. The disclosure of the fundamental role of
   the phenomenologically considered spatiality (Raumlichkeit) in the
   constitution of concrete historicity, i.e. historicity determined by the
   material, social and political character of Dasein and the world.
   Marcuse's interpretation and criticism of Heidegger's conception of
   historicity and his criticism of dehistorization based on it paves the
   way to his ontological interpretation of Marxist dialectics as the
   method of the struggle against dehistorization and false totality and as
   the only truly revolutionary way of thinking.

AB In this paper, the author traces down the evolution of social and
   political ideas of the eminent Russian philosopher of the 20th century
   Semyon Ludwigovich Frank (1877-1950). As a young man, Frank had been an
   adherent of the Marxist variety of radical socialism; only the events of
   1905-1907 led him, as well as other young intellectuals of his
   generation, such as Berdyaev, Bulgakov, Struve, Isgoev, Kistyakovski and
   others, to abandoning Marxism and positivism first for moderate
   Christian liberalism and then eventually for liberal conservatism. The
   immediate effect of the first Russian revolution on Frank was that he
   became member of the Constitutional Democratic Party and took part in
   1909 collection of essays Vekhi ('Landmarks'). The article, further on,
   contains a detailed analysis of the most important among Frank's
   writings in political philosophy, mainly intended to debunk the ideology
   of Russian revolutionary intelligentsia, such as Philosophical
   prerequisites of Despotism (1907), The Ethics of Nihilism (Frank's
   contribution to Vekhi, 1909), De profundis (an essay from the homonymous
   collection of 1918), and the emigrant publication Beyond the Left and
   the Right (1930).

   accompanying intellectual invigoration of workers at the turn of the
   twentieth century in Russian Poland. For proletarian readers Marxism was
   the main political language, ushering them into the public sphere and
   allowing them to comprehend the emerging capitalist world. As a
   particular liaison of scientific knowledge and a practical political
   weapon, it allowed its adherents to redefine themselves and make
   political claims. Such a situational Marxism, drawing from but not
   reducible to the prevailing 'orthodoxy', allows one to see the latter as

AB Labor falls under the category of social existence while human rights
   fit into the category of social consciousness. Unlike the human rights
   deriving directly from the thought of God-based natural rights,
   labor-based human rights need a sequence of intermediary transitions on
   the path of interpretation to be possible. According to value
   philosophy, labor constructs the useful value relation and purposeful
   value relation. In the social existence level, productivity is included
   in the useful value system and production relations are part of the
   purposeful value system. In the field of social consciousness, both
   political and ideological superstructures belong to the value system
   constructed by labor. Therefore, labor has constructed the relations of
   law at the class level and national level. Labor is the source of
   rights, which is the very concrete reflection of the labor value system
   in the superstructure. As recognized by law, human rights are, in form,
   the product built by all classes through labor; and in content, they as
   an ideology reflect the value relation between man and nature as well as
   between man and man. Therefore, it can be said that human rights come
   from labor.

AB This article seeks to explain a specific interpretation of the relation
   between philosophy and ideology which emerged in the period of 'Moscow
   philosophical thaw' and gained considerable popularity with the
   Sixtiers. The author centres his attention on two neo-Marxist theories,
   the theory of thinking as developed by Evald Ilyenkov and the theory of
   consciousness expounded by Merab Mamardashvili. It can be shown that
   both theories have much in common: they both use the term 'ideology'
   only as a pejorative; they share a similar understanding of 'the ideal'
   (Ilyenkov) and 'the form' (Mamardashvili); they give equally deep
   consideration to the problem of illusions, objective appearances,
   'objective forms of thinking' and 'converted forms'. Not only do
   Ilyenkov and Mamardashvili engage in a complex reciprocal interaction,
   they also interact with Kant as author of the essay on What is
   Enlightenment? An analysis of this 'timeless co-authorship' demonstrates
   that no struggle for the liberation of humankind from the power of
   ideologies can be successful unless a) a radical reform of education has
   been accomplished, b) philosophical education is promoted in a form that
   is free from the drawbacks and limitations of traditional enlightenment.

AB In the present article, the main theses of Boris Hessen's 1931 paper are
   brought under examination against the broader background of Russian
   philosophy in general and the philosophy and history of science in
   particular. Among other things, the author attempts to explain why
   Hessen's Marxist thinking met with little or no acceptance in the
   country of triumphant Marxism. In the Soviet Union, history and
   philosophy of science developed mainly within an internalist framework,
   first following mainly the positivist paradigm and later, from 1970s and
   1980s, gravitating toward the post-positivist approaches of Thomas Kuhn
   and Alexandre Koyre. Most of these studies, however, considered
   technological and socioeconomic factors to be of little relevance to the
   genesis of science. As a result, Hessen's ideas could find their place
   neither within the positivist nor within the post-positivist explanatory
   models used in Russian historical and philosophical studies of science.
   This only started to change at the beginning of the 1990s, in the
   post-Soviet era. Gradually, in a new intellectual climate, interest in
   Hessen's ideas began to grow. A compound answer to the problem posed at
   the beginning of the article is then outlined, taking as the starting
   point the holistic interpretation of Hessen's paper offered by Gideon
   Freudenthal and Peter McLaughlin.

AB The article is devoted to intellectual evolution of the Hungarian
   philosopher and ideologue Georg Lukacs (1885-1971) whose theoretical and
   political development reveals the character of the 20th century in a
   special way. In the first part of the article, the author, starting from
   the fact that Lukacs was awarded the Goethe Prize in Frankfurt am Main
   (1970), analyzes the antithetical origins of his philosophical position.
   The views of the thinker were formed under the influence of the
   sociologic vision of history and the concept of the generic forces of
   Marx. However, inspired by German culture Lukacs turned to the Goethe's
   ideal of the creative personality, in order to overcome the
   methodological one-sidedness of the Marxist image of a man oriented
   towards the socialized concept of labor.
   In the second part of the article, the author focuses on the hidden
   source of Lukacs' position: Nietzsche's metaphysics of power. He puts
   forward the thesis that the formation of Lukacs' revolution has been fed
   from the earliest times by the concepts of the philosophy of life. The
   subsequent involvement of the thinker in the ideological circle of the
   revolution and civil war weakened Nietzsche's influence. However, it can
   be traced in Lukacs' interpretation of culture as the creativity of the
   proletariat's liberated forces. The author raises the question of the
   extent of Lukacs' personal responsibility for violence, which the
   thinker understands as "the path to the rise and freedom of culture",
   going exclusively through dictatorship. The central theme of the fourth
   part of the article is the ideological influence exerted by Lukacs
   during the so-called "1968 revolution" in Germany, as well as a critical
   moral assessment of this influence. Refs 40.

AB In the midst of the 1960s alphabet soup of Marxist revolutionaries, an
   offshoot of Peru's Communist Party founded Shining Path. The rebel
   commander, philosophy professor Abimael Guzman, merged the pioneering
   work of Indo-American socialist Jose Carlos Mariategui (1894-1930) with
   dogmatic readings of Marx, Lenin and Mao. On 20-27 March 1980, party
   leaders read William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and Macbeth, a
   selection of Mao Zedong's early poetry, the memoirs of Peru's field
   marshal Andres A. Caceres, Washington Irving's The Life of Mahomet,
   Joseph Stalin's 3 July 1941 radio address, and Aeschylus' Prometheus
   Bound. This essay argues these literary readings prepared the party to
   conduct war by identifying the enemy within, establishing an
   esprit-de-corps, and enshrining Guzman as undisputed leader. The timing
   of the literary sessions coincides with the initiation of a guerrilla
   war that claimed 69,000 lives and billions of dollars in damage. The
   principles that nourished Shining Path's authoritarianism persist today,
   albeit in mutated form, as political dogmatism emerges to battle
   reformist policies that deviate from the perceived interests of a
   radicalized base. The review of Shining Path's literary system aims to
   prevent us from unwisely claiming contemporary postcolonial religious,
   secular or national fundamentalisms within our communities as senseless,
   savage or irrational anachronisms.

AB What is the "Soviet trauma" in philosophy? We consider the case of Evald
   Ilyenkov, a Marxist who stood against positivism and physicalism in
   understanding the human mind. Ilyenkov discussed the political and
   socio-anthropological consequences of positivism, both for the West and
   the Soviet system. Ilyenkov's social and methodological criticism is
   based on his pedagogical theory of personality and presupposes a utopia
   of the full personal appropriation of the universal. His pedagogy is a
   mix of materialistic psychology and transcendental philosophy.
   Ilyenkov's pedagogical utopia is also a key to his political utopia.
   According to Ilyenkov, only a cultural revolution that moves beyond
   socialism will overcome alienation. He understood the alienation of
   human beings as an alienation from the total nature of mankind.
   Alienation is a product of private property in a broad sense. The
   principle of private property implies a positivist logic, which in its
   turn produces technocratism. Ilyenkov opposes the scientistic logic of
   adding up particular facts to the dialectic logic of proceeding from the
   whole. The rightly educated person reconstitutes the whole and
   transgresses the principle of particularity. The last principle is
   considered as the main feature and the main vice of modern society.
   Ilyenkov avoided the question whether any mode of power (and violence)
   is produced by this logic of the whole. To investigate this question, we
   invoke Ilyenkov's works that previously have not been considered as
   having political meaning. Based on this extended corpus, we try to
   reconstruct Ilyenkov's system of political philosophy.

AB In Reflections on the Philosophy of Hitlerism (1934) and in the face of
   the rise of Nazism in Europe, Levinas calls the European civilization,
   in particular, the Jewish, Christian, Liberal and Marxist traditions, to
   confront the emergence of the elementary philosophy of Hitlerism. In
   this short article, the philosopher urges those traditions to trace
   their identities back to their sources, intuitions and original
   decisions, in particular, to the "spirit of freedom" that animates them
   and to their conceptions of human destiny (Levinas, 1990: 64). However,
   in contemporary reception on Levinas' reflections there's a
   methodological and political discussion about how to interpret this
   appeal to a common "spirit" or "feeling" shared by European traditions,
   as well as about the meaning that acquires the elementary and
   threatening counterpart that is Hitlerism. This paper aims to inquire
   into some aspects of this methodological and political debate aroused by
   interwar writings of Levinas.

AB This essay traces out a new organization of Louis Althusser's work that
   rests on his fundamental educational problematic: interpellation. There
   are three moments where Althusser discusses education in his writings:
   in the famous essay on schools as Ideological State Apparatuses, in his
   infamous essay on the university and the pedagogical function, and in a
   much more obscure reference to trade unions. In all three, Althusser is
   dealing with the problem of interpellation, yet none of these essays
   enable us to actually theorize what Althusser's own practice of the
   seminar offers as educational logic-a practice that resulted in the
   student-teacher collaboration Reading Capital. In short, whereas the
   Institutional State Apparatus interpellates individuals and the trade
   union offers a counterinterpellation, the seminar is a form of
   disinterpellation that must be thought of as the educational unconscious
   of Althusser's late writings on the encounter.

AB Contemporary China needs to change from a Western to a Chinese-style
   governance discourse so as to form and explore a consultative governance
   discourse with Chinese characteristics. This is profoundly evident in
   the following: the Marxist philosophy of the state is the theoretical
   premise of contemporary China's consultative governance; traditional
   Chinese thought on governance and practice are the soil in which
   contemporary Chinese consultative governance grows; socialism with
   Chinese characteristics is the realm in which contemporary Chinese
   consultative governance exists; the masses under the leadership of the
   CPC are the necessary subjects of contemporary Chinese consultative
   governance; and the target of contemporary Chinese consultative
   governance is a multi-layered and diverse existence. Realization of
   national governance through consultative democracy is the basic form of
   contemporary Chinese consultative governance; the balanced development
   of public, collective and individual interests is the basic objective of
   contemporary Chinese consultative governance; the basic principles of
   contemporary Chinese consultative governance are equality, inclusiveness
   and peace; and the criteria for assessing contemporary Chinese
   consultative governance are authority, consensus, institutions and the
   rule of law. Guided by the Marxist view of the state, rooted in the
   tradition of China's fine political culture, and founded on the
   theoretical and practical claims of socialism with Chinese
   characteristics, socialist consultative governance with Chinese
   characteristics constitutes the Chinese form of contemporary governance
   theory.

   positive trend of her reception as a consequence of the need of left
   intellectuals to search new symbolic sources to re-legitimate
   themselves. However, beyond this shared master narrative the reception
   of Arendt's in the singular SSH disciplinary fields of the two countries
   presents many differences as different are their social and symbolic
   spaces and boundaries and their position in the respective national
   hierarchy of academic disciplines. Aim of the paper is then to analyze
   Arendt's reception within some pivotal disciplines (i.e. political
   science, political philosophy) in light of their cultural and
   institutional history and of the influence of their respective national
   political cultural context, in particular for what regards their public

AB The article deals with philosophical and political views of Murtaza
   Mutahhari (1902-1989), one of the most remarkable thinkers of modern
   Iran. Mutahhari was known as the disciple and the closest associate of
   Ayatollah Khomeini the leader of the Iranian Revolution of 1978-1979.
   Mutahhari was working on his ideology, which could be: first, a
   realistic alternative to Shah Reza Pahlavi's ideological doctrine and
   the theories of Islamic Marxists, and secondly, the acceptable source of
   legitimacy of Islamic Rule. Islamic theories of political structure have
   traditionally evolved as a result of philosophical reflection on the
   fundamental problems, such as: the understanding of God and the
   relationship between God and world, God and man, the basis of just
   governance of Islamic society and Islamic state and so on. The close
   relationship between religion, philosophy and politics was reflected
   most clearly in Mutahhari' discourse: he recognizes the need to
   establish the form of Islamic government in Iran and creates for its
   justification a special ideology, using the statements of Islamic
   doctrine and Islamic values.

AB The work reviews and analyzes the reception of the French Catholic

   Mounier (1905-1950) in Croatia and the former Yugoslavia until 1965. It
   investigates the articles on Mounier, his own works as well as his
   influence on personalistic endeavours in the region. First brief echoes
   of his thought on Catholic and pronounced thinkers in Croatia can be
   found as early as in 1930-ies, however, without any relevant positive or
   negative criticism. Namely, Mounier's tendency towards Marxism and
   socialism was not acceptable for them. Croatian emigrants adhered to
   such reserved sentiments towards Mounier. After the Second World War the
   only acceptable standpoint was Marxist and personalism, being considered
   as a 'bourgeois philosophy", was denied. The only exception was Mounier,
   to whom the post-war Marxists have an ambivalent attitude and after the
   break of Tito and Stalin in 1948, even a positive one. This is a
   philosophical-historical rarity, taking into account that Mounier was an
   apparent Catholic thinker. Hence reception of Mounier can be considered
   as a vanguard of the so-called convergence of Christianity and Marxism
   in 1960-ies but also as a political pragmatism of then Yugoslav official
   ideology.

   themes through the prism of the subject-object relationship. The themes
   under discussion include: nature (the universe, the cosmos, and
   reality), the human agent, personality, individuality, subjectivity, and
   the topic of a cognitive and active relationship between the human and
   the world. The article shows that the unity of the subject matter of
   philosophy can be defined only in the most general terms, since the
   above main themes are only partially and idiosyncratically reflected in

AB The term of aesthetic was put forward by German philosopher A.G.
   Baumgarten in the mid-18th century. Since Baumgarten in the historical
   process, the way aesthetic philosophy came into existence, process of
   its methodology, hypothetical principles and scientific methods have
   always been based on the methodology of philosophy. At this point, some
   philosophers have been determinative to change the general methodology
   and perspective of aesthetics. Thus, by virtue of these theorists
   aesthetics have philosophical characteristics and their sources,
   targets, metaphysical processes and methodologies have been
   institutionalized.
   The thought of aesthetics made progress in the 18th century when art was
   theoretically and historically analyzed. This progress was made
   especially because of certain philosophers. Hegel, Kant and Marx can be
   given as examples. Kant based the terms of aesthetics, aesthetic
   experience and beauty totally on subjective basis and with the dialectic
   of aesthetic judgment power he introduced the perception of criticism to
   aesthetics and art. Hegel doctrinated art in the light of modern
   philosophy and introduced the concepts such as talent and technique to
   the field of aesthetics. While these philosophers systematized the
   aesthetics, after 1940s materialist Marxist dialectic replaced the
   Hegelian dialectic. Marx was the architect of this change.
   In this study, the aim is to put forward the general laws of aesthetic
   philosophy, understanding of aesthetic and art in the conversation
   process of aesthetic process into an idealistic materialistic dialectic
   and its relationship with other fields of art.

   of Ilyenkov's Dialectics of the Ideal. The approach the authors take to
   Ilyenkov's work differs from previous ones of exploring the totality of
   Ilyenkov's thought or eclectic aspects of it. By commenting on and
   contextualising Ilyenkov's major text on the Ideal they locate the
   contribution of Ilyenkov in dialogue with traditions of classical
   European philosophy, and Western and Soviet Marxism, and in his
   importance to contemporary issues in philosophy and other disciplines. A
   deep analysis of Ilyenkov's dense and often complex text is also given.
   By doing so the authors highlight the immense contribution of Ilyenkov

   theology burst on the Passagen-Werk: "My thinking is to theology as
   blotting paper is to ink. It is completely saturated with it. But if the
   blotting paper had its way, nothing would remain of what was written"
   (PW N7a7). The kind of theological invisibility confessed here as in a
   heretic palimpsest is part of a trick which was familiar to cabbalistic
   studies: to make one's own text invisible. What seems to be particular
   to Benjamin, however, is the agonistic but nevertheless heuristic way in
   which he intends to use theology in order to shake, disarray and
   deconstruct the established philosophy, particularly its dominant trends
   in the field of the theory of history: historicism, positivism and the
   evolutionary Hegelian-Marxist philosophy of history. In this paper we
   try to show how this theological perspective is applied to a Benjaminian
   grammar of time. We conclude by comparing the resulting Benjaminian
   notion of historical past both against a text of young Heiddeger (1915)
   and a fragment of Max Horkheimer (1937).

AB Introduction: the article is devoted to the analysis of the genesis of
   the Soviet theory of law, in particular, of the sociological concept of
   law by P. Stuchka. In this regard, the relation of jurisprudence with
   other social sciences, such as philosophy, political science and
   sociology, acquires particular importance. Special attention is paid to
   the attempts of reconciliation of Marx's concept of withering away of
   the state and the law in a communist society with the realities of the
   young Soviet state. Purpose: to form a concept of prerequisites and
   peculiarities of formation of Russian legal theory in the 1920-30s.
   Methods: theoretical methods of formal and dialectic logic have been
   applied. Results: the analysis shows that in their attempt to reconcile
   Marxist theory with the reality and inner logic of the law the Soviet
   jurists relied on the achievements of pre-revolutionary Russian legal
   theory, primarily a sociological theory of law. In addition, the
   relative epistemic pluralism of social sciences in the first decades of
   the Soviet regime allowed them to elaborate original concepts, for
   example, the concept of codification. Conclusions: the Soviet theory of
   law in its early stages faced the problems of determining the essence
   and the content of law, and of the relationship between the law, state
   and society of a new type. The problems were caused by the dominant
   ideology of Marxism-Leninism and epistemological obstacles in legal
   knowledge. The attempts to solve these problems undertaken by the Soviet
   jurists are of great interest to modern legal theorists who are in
   search for appropriate methods of legal research.

AB Within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on
   Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol, international carbon politics
   inevitably presents itself as the logic or essence of "ecological
   imperialism," reflecting a few Western countries' expansion and
   development of their historically formed international hierarchical
   superiority or exclusive hegemony on the basis of their domestic
   capitalist economies and politics. This is an intrinsic obstacle to
   creating a more equitable, democratic and effective global climate or
   environmental governance system. Criticism of international carbon
   politics and its " ecological imperialism," based on traditional
   "green-left" theories from Marxist philosophy and political economy,
   provides a theoretical basis for seeking an alternative way to cope with
   global climate change effectively. As a responsible developing country,
   China's response to climate change is not only an internal requirement
   for the promotion of its own sustainable development, but also reflects
   its responsibility to create a community of shared future for mankind.
   This rationale for our time determines that it is necessary for China to
   become a world leader in coping with global climate change and
   environmental governance through a leadership which lies in making a
   contribution rather than fighting for hegemony.

AB Isabelle Garo's study, Foucault, Deleuze, Althusser & Marx: La politique
   dans la philosophie, presents a historical approach to the French
   philosophy of the 1960s and 1970s and its relationship to Marx and the
   Marxist tradition. In her view, these authors were captured by a largely
   mistaken understanding of the resources present in Marxist thought, and
   were overly affected by the prejudices instilled by the French Communist
   Party. Speaking from a perspective of practical commitment, she traces a
   path from early French Marxism to an anti-totalitarian consensus. Her
   study renders Louis Althusser's innovations the most pivotal in
   introducing a whole series of themes, with ambivalent effects on
   theoretical production today. Most significantly, she discerns a
   replacement of politics and political economy by philosophy and
   epistemology. She attends first to the mobilisation of psychoanalysis
   against humanism, which gave way to a vehement critique of the normative
   aspects of psychoanalysis itself. Re-reading Foucault and Deleuze as
   post-Althusserians, Garo suggests that this led to a championing of
   Friedrich Nietzsche's viewpoints against Marx. Garo's study is immensely
   valuable in contextualising the apparent innovations of
   poststructuralist thought. However, we can discern greater relevance for
   the insights of these thinkers for contemporary Marxist thought than
   Garo concedes, and her attempt to read them as a complete deviation from
   Marxist principles ultimately fails to convince.

AB Li Zehou belongs to the most well-known and influential contemporary
   Chinese philosophers of our time. Since he is one of the exiled
   intellectuals, his work has also acquired a wide readership outside
   China. Working mostly in the fields of classical Chinese philosophy and
   Chinese aesthetics, he dedicated himself to the task of finding a
   suitable and sensible way of harmonizing past and present, tradition and
   modernity, China and the West. Hence, he attempted to create a synthesis
   between early Marxist and classical Confucian discourses. The present
   article offers a critical analysis of these attempts, focusing upon some
   significant methodological problems underlying such approaches. The
   author aims to explain them in the framework of the methodology of

AB Contemporary Russian philosophical traditions cannot be reduced to
   Marxist works and research in religious philosophy. Russian philosophers
   developed philosophy and methodology of social sciences and humanities
   as early as at the end of the nineteenth century and in the beginning of
   the twentieth century. In particular, S.N. Bulgakov's social philosophy
   of science is closely related to European thinkers' works and ideas.
   Problems of social determinism in scientific cognition are among them.
   These problems are topical now as seen in the well-known discussion
   about the nature and meaning of various forms of determinism (1990) in
   which different stands are taken by R. Thomas, E. Morin and I.
   Prigogine. A new level of research of social determinism is presented in
   Russia in the second-half of the twentieth century. The identification
   of determination with causality is overcome. Necessary and contingent
   (probabilistic), dynamic and statistical determination,
   self-determination, and so on, come under examination. In the 1970s
   mechanistic and objectivistic determination is overcome and human
   factors, such as the will and systems of values, are taken into account.
   S.L. Frank turns to the methodology of social sciences in 1922 and
   continues his studies in 1930 in Europe. Frank creates a holistic, fully
   secular doctrine of social philosophy, sociology, philosophy of law and
   history. The changing situation in Russia at the end of the twentieth
   century and the beginning of the twenty first century allows us to
   re-evaluate ideas and works of Russian thinkers who studied mainly
   rationalist themes, including philosophy and methodology of science, its
   hermeneutic and semiotic aspects. Russian and European philosophies are
   used and essentially enriched. G.G. Shpet's ideas are examined. Studying
   the sphere of language and meaning, recognizing the essential importance
   of hermeneutics for knowledge in the humanities, he brings forward a
   semiotic conception of ethnic psychology to precede, in particular,
   American anthropologist and ethnographer C. Geertz's theory of culture.
   Russian philosophers are quite aware that any reconstruction of real
   cognition cannot limit itself to the transcendental epistemological
   agent or consciousness in general. It is necessary to change the level
   of abstraction of the subject matter of the non-classicalsocial,
   cultural and historicalepistemology to draw closer to the real
   manifestations of cognitive activity.

   known today in the academic world and beyond. However, his first
   systematic account of the subject (Theorie du Sujet) was already
   published in 1982 and did not mention the 'event' at all. Therefore,
   this article aims at tracing back both the structural and the historical
   conditions that directed Badiou's elaboration of the subject in the
   early work up until the publication of L'Etre et l'Evenement in 1988. On
   the one hand, it investigates to what extent the (early) Badiouan
   subject can be considered an exceptional product of the formalist
   project of the Cahiers pour l'Analyse as instigated by psychoanalytical
   discourse (Lacan) and a certain Marxist discourse (Althusser) insofar as
   both were centered upon a theory of the subject. On the other hand, this
   article examines the radical political implications of this subject
   insofar as Badiou has directed his philosophical aims towards the
   political field as a direct consequence of the events of May'68.

AB This article takes food issues in both the advanced capitalist and
   developing worlds, as well as discourses and struggles that have
   developed in response to them, as a point of departure. The exposition
   begins with a description of food sovereignty movements and their
   successful struggles. Third-world campaigns for food security are
   inspiring cases of resistance, of struggle for disalienation. The focus
   then shifts to the problems with the contemporary North American diet,
   and the 'foodie' response to the epidemic of poor eating and resulting
   poor health. Foodie culture as it has developed in the advanced
   capitalist world has severe limitations, particularly in regards to its
   treatment of gender and class. Yet it also contains important messages
   about meaningful human interaction with nature in the form of food
   procurement and preparation. The analysis developed here strives to go
   further than a critique of the distribution and availability of
   foodstuffs in the contemporary capitalist economy. The aim is to
   understand contestations over both the production and consumption of
   food in terms of some key categories of Marxist philosophy. It is argued
   that using the concepts of alienation, division of labour, and
   production of consumption can strengthen the case for food sovereignty
   while also mounting a critique of foodie culture that nonetheless
   preserves its constructive insights. More specifically, this means that
   an exploration of the relationship between the division of labour and
   alienation can demonstrate the negative consequences of industrially
   produced foods, while affirming the necessity of alternative forms of
   food production and consumption. Everywhere and in different ways,
   capitalism alienates humans from their species-being. This article
   argues that this fact is particularly evident with regards to the
   industrial food system. However, just as food can be a site of
   oppression, so too can it be a locus of struggle against capital.

AB This article addresses the ideological context of twentieth-century
   history of science as it emerged and was discussed at the threshold of
   the Cold War. It is claimed that the bifurcation of the discipline into
   a socio-economic strand and a technical-intellectual one (the divide
   between externalism' and internalism') should be traced back to the
   1930s. In fact, the proposal of a Marxist-oriented historiography by the
   Soviet delegates at the International Congress of History of Science and
   Technology (London, 1931) led by Nikolai Bukharin, set off the
   ideological and methodological opposition that characterised the later
   years. Bukharin's views on science are closely considered, as well as
   those of his Marxist critics, Gyorgy Lukacs and Antonio Gramsci. It is
   argued that, despite the fluidity of the positions of the 1920s and
   1930s, these theories soon crystallized as demonstrated by the leftist
   reception of Bukharin's and his associates' perspective in the history
   of science, especially in Great Britain, as well as by the
   anti-communist reactions. Intellectualist approaches renouncing
   socio-economic factors, typically those by Alexandre Koyre and Thomas
   Kuhn, are reconsidered in the light of the ideological confrontation of
   the Cold War era. Reflection on the political-cultural embedding of the
   history of science has often been overshadowed by claims about the
   objectivity and neutrality of science and its historiography. Thus, the
   seminal discussion of the 1930s remains one of the most lucid moments of
   reflection about the role of science and history of science as cultural
   phenomena shaped by political struggles.

AB Introduction Almost all schools of Indian philosophy including Buddhism
   and Jainism have condemned Lokayata as a very base philosophy and
   relegated it to an uncivilized and unethical status that deserved no
   merit or appreciation. On the other hand, many modern scholars who
   focused on the study of Lokayata invariably looked at it from the
   Marxist ideological perspective, only finding in it a school revolting
   against spiritualism of the then-extant Vedic schools and even class
   conflict between the priest class and the commoners. Since no original
   work of this school survives intact to the present day, it is difficult
   to comprehend its true line of thought only from very scanty and
   dispersed statements and verses attributed to it in the works of other
   schools.
   Discussion While medieval philosophers painted it negatively,
   exaggerating only its weak points and even interpreting its aphorisms to
   be base and mean, modern scholars want us to believe that Lokayata
   represents class conflict and is antithetical to spiritualism. But if it
   were just a base and laymen's ideology, how did it survive over two
   millennia compelling every other school of philosophy to comment on it?
   Conclusion Is it possible that the original Lokayata school tried to
   present something significant, but it was disparagingly combined with
   other inferior ideologies by its adversaries with malfeasance and
   interpreted it wrongly to make it look base and mean? Has Lokayata got a
   lot more to offer than just being an anti-fiefdom ideology? This paper
   tries to examine the tenets of Lokayata school that are in vogue and
   suggests the possibility that Lokayata could have been a
   'live-in-the-present' spiritual school like the Zen.

   shift towards a dialogue with Marx and his critique of political economy
   but in the 1970s prominent Marxists attacked Deleuze (and Guattari) as
   anti-Marxist. This attitude marked one of the most important missed
   encounters between Marxism and other theoretical currents. However,
   there have been important recent contributions that bring forward not
   only the political character of Deleuze's theoretical endeavour, his
   critique of capitalist social forms, his conception of social practice
   and struggle, but also the linkages with the Marxian and Marxist

AB The project of renewing historical materialist theory for a new
   generation requires overcoming the limitations of Althusserian
   structuralism. Upon investigation, Althusser's theory is revealed to be
   idealist, inconsistent with the philosophy actually articulated by Marx,
   and unhelpful in understanding the dynamics of human societies. The
   flaws in this approach led both to E. P. Thompson's rejection of
   abstract theory altogether, and Michael Lebowitz's effort to "complete"
   Marx's theoretical project, while avoiding Althusser's structural
   determinism by incorporating agency and social struggle into the heart
   of political economy. Yet Lebowitz's theoretical system has very little
   to say about how these were historically practiced by classes as
   institutional formations in different spatio-temporal contexts. In this
   respect, the "Institutional Marxist" approach developed by Leo Panitch
   and Sam Gindin shows the most promise for further developing today's
   revival of historical materialism.

AB This essay investigates a novel from 2012 by Jenny Erpenbeck, an East
   German author born in 1967 and a member of an influential intellectual
   family in the GDR. In the novel, Erpenbeck looks back at the history of
   European socialism in the twentieth century by depicting the life of a
   female protagonist patterned after Hedda Zinner, her own paternal
   grandmother. In its historical dimension, the novel is ultimately
   intended as a literary demonstration of not only the demise of utopian
   socialist thought after 1990, but also of the loss of philosophic
   idealism of the European Enlightenment. Erpenbeck's refutation of the
   teleological dialectic of history as posited by Hegelian and Marxist
   concepts is achieved through the narrative structure of her novel. The
   author's notion of the history of philosophy relies strongly on
   postmodernist ideas of accidental nature [Zufalligkeit] and the
   essential open-endedness of history.

AB Herbert Marcuse's early essays and reviews written while under the

   the most sympathetic of his critics widely focus on either his
   deviations from existing Marxist orthodoxy, or his failure to
   demonstrate the commensurability of Marxism and existentialism. Although
   both these concerns highlight important problems in Marcuse's work, this
   narrow focus of Marcuse scholarship neglects essential aspects of his
   early thought, particularly his concern with what types of truth claims
   inform political action, and how one might assess the validity of these
   claims. This article examines these overlooked facets of Marcuse's early

   terrorism in Europe exposed the indissoluble link between dialectics and

   reconstructive effort for a new political and social order. But in the
   age of Silvio Berlusconi, Vattimo rediscovered the joy of political
   commitment. Ecce Comu was a call to pursue "a project of human
   emancipation" founded "on the search for equality" More recently, Of
   Reality and Hermeneutic Communism are a rejection of neoliberal
   philosophies and constitute a jump back to the 1970s. Vattimo aims once
   again to change the world and reality, a reality that other philosophies
   (Ferraris's New Realism) simply contemplate as a pure fact. Vattimo
   defends the "revolutionary" meaning of hermeneutics against realism's
   conservative tendencies and develops a project close to Gramsci's

AB Literature is the bearer of all the treasures in the world-that includes
   the Filipino's ideology and philosophy, which are reflected in their own
   literatures. This literary analysis is a descriptive-qualitative
   research, employing the Marxist criticism in the assumptions related to
   the literary persona in Ricaredo Demetillo's Barter in Panay.
   Specifically, the literary analysis unveils the relationship between the
   poet's milieu and his literary persona, the socio-political phenomena
   revealed by the literary persona, and the critical views on race and
   power relations based on the construction of the poet's literary
   persona. The findings reveal that Demetillo, by projecting himself in
   his literary persona, Datu Sumakwel as a capitalist, favors today's
   capitalism and displays him to be a bourgeois proletarian. Through the
   assumptions regarding the literary persona in Demetillo's literary epic,
   we can hear the voices of the folks in the past who were the ruling
   class, and the voices of the modern folks-both the ruling and the ruled
   in today's world. The persona's poetic voice comes from the memory of
   every Filipino who lives in the here and the now, who passes the
   folkloric and historical records of ideologies to the younger

AB The study on the historiography of Russian museology, started in 2015,
   needs to continue. Knowledge of the museum history makes it possible to
   maintain that at the turn of the 1920-30-s the paradigm of museology
   changed. Categories of the Marxist-Leninist philosophy - theory and
   practice - were the basis for the new concept of museum science. It was
   formulated at the First All-Russia Museum Congress. Very soon, the
   theory was understood as instructions of the Central Committee of the
   Communist Party and the Soviet Government. The concept of practice was
   regarded as the implementation of those directives in museums. Museums
   were stripped of academic significance and were turned into institutions
   for political education. Rebirth of museology occurred in the post-World
   War II period. The main event in this process was the extended session
   of the Institute of Regional Studies and Museum Work, held in 1948. The
   participants of the session returned the significance of an academic
   discipline for museology. A.M. Razgon published an article in The Great
   Soviet Encyclopedia in 1974. He wrote that museology was an academic
   discipline which studied the origin of museums, their public functions,
   and questions of theory and methods of museum science. Later, in 1988,
   this definition was repeated in the book Muzeevedenie. Muzei
   istoricheskogo profilya [Museology. Museums of A Historical Profile].
   The authors called museology an academic discipline. At the same time,
   they included independent academic disciplines ( museum theory, history
   of museum science, museum source studies) in its structure. In fact,
   they reflected on museology as on a complex of academic knowledge on
   museum science, but did not recognize it. In the 1990s, the
   socio-political development of the Russian society hanged. Consequently,
   a new non-politicized concept of museology was required. Response to the
   public demand was The Russian Museum Encyclopedia (Moscow, 2001. Vol.
   1-2). The authors of the Encyclopedia summed up Russian museology,
   identified gaps in museum knowledge. Their definition of museology, in
   fact, was the same as in the 1980s. Museologists of today underestimate
   the achievements of their predecessors. We can say there was no shift in
   the museology paradigm. Nevertheless, there is a clear movement towards
   a change of the paradigm. It is expressed in the intensive research of
   the museum science history, in the attention to the experience of
   pre-revolutionary museology, in the development of the historiography of
   museum science. The widening and deepening of problems, the improvement
   of museum study methodology identify new questions for discussion, and
   their solution needs a new investigation.

AB In 1943, Henryk Grossman sent a draft of the study, eventually published
   in two parts as The Evolutionist Revolt against Classical Economics', to
   Max Horkheimer for comment. His very hostile response, Grossman's drafts
   and the published study cast light not only on the changing relationship
   between Grossman and Horkheimer but also on the distance between
   Grossman's classical Marxism and nascent mature Critical Theory.
   Grossman's study identified the emergence of the idea of successive
   economic systems in the work of Condorcet, Henri Saint-Simon and Simonde
   de Sismondi in France, James Steuart and Richard Jones in England,
   culminating in Marx's formulations which entailed the role of class
   struggle and capitalism's tendency to break down. Hegel was not an
   influence on Marx's conception of modes of production. In addition to a
   series of spurious and minor criticisms, Horkheimer objected that
   Grossman's approach was positivist, that it misconceived Hegel's
   philosophy, and that it amounted to a conventional history of ideas. In
   response, Grossman made some changes in his study, but these were
   designed to strengthen his main arguments and successfully reaffirmed
   his Marxist approach in the face of Horkheimer's criticisms.

AB A new collection of essays edited by Michael J. Thompson aims to
   explicate and defend the humanist values which, according to the
   authors, were the core of Marx's critique of capitalist society. The
   text does not aim to provide a political roadmap to building an
   alternative society in which those values could be realized but rather
   philosophical analysis of the meaning and implications of those values.
   While there are sometimes tensions between the philosophical arguments
   developed in the various essays that make up the text and the traditions
   of Marxist political practice, the book as a whole certainly proves that
   the human values of Marx's philosophy are central to his politics and
   that his emancipatory vision remains relevant, even necessary.

AB During the twentieth century a number of competing accounts of Lenin's
   theory and practice have sought to reclaim its true meaning from
   ossification under Stalinism. One account popular today is the
   Hegelian-Marxist interpretation of Lenin's Philosophical Notebooks
   written in 1914 and 1915. According to thinkers such as Raya
   Dunayevskaya and Kevin Anderson, Lenin's notebooks on Hegel's Science of
   Logic represent a radical break from classical dialectical materialism.
   For these Hegelian-Marxists, Lenin's acerbic remarks on Engels's and
   Plekhanov's dialectics reveal him as the forerunner of Georg Lukacs and
   Herbert Marcuse and represent a thoroughgoing reconceptualization of the
   dialectics of revolution. In this article I submit these arguments to
   the test of a fine grained textual analysis. I conclude, opposite to the
   Hegelian-Marxist narrative, that Lenin neither intended to nor
   accomplished a refoundation of Marxist dialectics in 1914. The notion of
   quantity-quality leaps Lenin adds to his works from 1914 onwards show
   him less as an innovator in Marxist philosophy and more as a keeper of
   the flame of dialectical materialist orthodoxy.

   hypothesized that the particular itinerary of Gramsci's Marxism, which
   came to be defined as anti-determinist, may have been influenced by
   certain philosophical currents (United States and European pragmatism,
   French post-positivist epistemology) outside the tradition of the Second
   and Third Internationals. In attempting to challenge a certain revision
   of Marxism belonging to late nineteenth-century positivism, the young
   Gramsci made use of theoretical equipment that belonged to epistemology,
   together with pragmatist psychology, which taken as a whole allowed him
   to retrace and relaunch the theoretical status of Marx's philosophy.

   (1921-2000) represents some aspects of the contributions as well as the
   deficiencies present in a tradition that so far has only been partially
   studied by the history of Venezuelan historiography. Thus, this article
   intends to carry out a critical approach to the fundamentals and the
   philosophy of history manifested in the work of the historian,
   anthropologist and ethnologist from the state of Aragua. During the
   research, we revised and analyzed the main historical works produced by
   Brito from 1941 to 2000. We made use of German Carrera Damas' famous
   scheme from the 1960's to guide the research on the most known
   Venezuelan historians. This paper pretends to show how Brito Figueroa's
   conception of history oscillated among his profession as a historian and
   his fervent affiliation and support for Marxism.

AB The article analyzes the project of scientific justification of language
   Reforms, realized by the Soviet regime in 20s and 30s, elaborated by
   Russian and Soviet linguist Evgenij Polivanov (1891-1938). Polivanov
   claims that a Soviet linguist should not limit his interests to the
   "general linguistics" and become an active "language builder" and
   "language politician". The reforms should be carefully planned by the
   experts in language sciences who master as well the methodology of
   dialectical materialism. In the polemics against Nikolai Marr's
   Japhetidology Polivanov argued that linguistics is a strict science and
   its deductions are not contradictory to Marxism, as the latter is
   primarily a materialist philosophy. His minimal program consisted in
   explaining his views on the evolution of language in the Marxist terms.
   The evolution of language is explained by the influence of internal and
   external factors. The socio-economical factors are not influencing the
   language in a direct manner, but their analysis allows to change the
   channel of language evolution. According to Polivanov, the introduction
   of Marxism into linguistics will make possible to explain the
   relationship between intralinguistic and extralinguistic factors and
   will transform the sciences of language into "social engineering of the
   future".

AB Cinema, in its most massively produced and widely disseminated format in
   the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, is violent. In dialogue with
   both the public discourse and scholarship regarding the cinematic
   representation of violence, this paper approaches film violence through
   a Marxist framework. It does so to propose that the philosophy of Karl
   Marx reveals critical insight regarding the relationship between cinema,
   violence, and capital. In particular, this essay scrutinizes commercial
   narrative cinema and thus approaches cinema as hegemony. The violence of
   cinema is considered to have a role in reproducing the social
   organization of capitalism, namely the hierarchical relationship between
   the ruling and ruled classes. Cinema has historically used violence in
   narrative and spectacle to propagate these relations of production, the
   ontology of capitalism that consists of Cartesian subjectivity and its
   vertical orientation towards the Other. In other words, violent cinema
   is crucial for the subject in capitalism, for it shares the pivotal
   function of perpetuating class antagonism. But because cinema must
   constantly mediate the violence of capital, simultaneously obfuscating
   it while also maintaining it, violent cinema - like the proletariat -
   also holds the emancipatory potential of its own critique and eventual
   dismantling.

   he tried to create a synthesis between early Marxist and classical
   Confucian discourses. Through a critical analysis of these attempts, the
   present article reveals some crucial theoretical problems underlying
   such efforts. Considering the fact that in contemporary China, the link
   between Confucian and Marxist philosophy is a much discussed (and rather
   controversial) topic, the paper also represents a contribution to the

AB Where can we find Marxism today? Answering this question raises a
   problem that Jacques Derrida assumed when he said: "there is more than
   one of them, there must be more than one of them (them meaning Marx's
   ghosts)" Then, which is the Marx that Althusser invites us to read and
   to translate into political action? The aim of this text is to trace the
   guidelines of the Marx that Althusser shapes (through the concepts of
   political practice and theoretical practice) in Alvaro Garcia Linera's
   thought.
   These althusserian concepts allow us to propose Alvaro Garcia Linera as
   the "heir" (Derrida, 1995) of Marxist philosophy and as a theorist of
   revolution today. His militant condition and his position as Bolivia's
   vice-president determine his theoretical production because he does not
   develop this production in the middle of nothingness but writes in a
   very particular political situation. Thus, we can understand that Garcia
   Linera addresses in his theoretical practice something that is
   objectively present in the historical process during which, and about
   which, he is writing: the liberating power of the indigenous people.
   We are going to focus on Linera's re-reading of the Communist Manifesto
   though these althusserian concepts in order to get a deeper scope of a
   thought that invokes Marx at the same time that it highlights the
   necessity of thinking within the political situation. By doing this, we
   are not aiming to make conclusions about its truthfulness or falsehood;
   instead, we are trying to produce a political analysis of his discourse
   in order to research the contradictions which emerge when Marx is read
   through the variants that the political situation proposes and, by doing
   this, we are also trying to deepen the studies in communication and
   politics.
   We will also go through interviews, conferences and other texts written
   by the vice president of Bolivia to locate the most recent developements
   of his thoughts. Our aim is to start tracing a series of interlocutors
   with which Garcia Linera contends and argues, in order to set the basis
   of a research process that will deepen the analysis of his works.

AB This essay offers a socialist feminist postcolonial interpretation of
   the Anthropocene concept as used in recent ecocriticism. In contesting
   the rigid positioning of Humanity over Nature, the paper draws on the
   Marxist psychoanalytic theory of non-identity in Theodor Adorno (1973)
   and Julia Kristeva (1973, 1977, 1978). Making an ecofeminist
   contribution to the new field of environmental humanities, it engages
   critically with the perspective of prominent US scholar Timothy Morton
   (2012). Its embodied materialist argument is that contemporary
   Eurocentric institutions, science, and philosophies are indeed shaped by
   affect as Morton believes, but not in the way that he envisages. In
   addition, it is suggested that the socialist feminist postcolonial
   politics of ecofeminism is already challenging the inevitable
   universality of the Anthropocene by building an Earth Democracy with
   epistemologies of care. It is concluded that understanding the
   Anthropocene notion, a phenomenon that is profoundly gendered, requires
   more than thinking in "deep geological time." Ultimately, all ecological
   awareness will demand a capacity for thinking in "deep libidinal time."

   relationship between economy and environment, the implementation of
   low-carbon economy has become an inevitable choice for the national
   development, which means that we need to explain low-carbon economy from
   economic theories. Traditional Western mainstream economics ignored
   low-carbon economyin terms of the scope and the fundamental theories.
   Based on the author's learning and teaching experience for many years,
   this article first interprets low-carbon economy in Marx's economic
   theory and proposesdevelopment measures of low-carbon economy from the

AB "Realistic Individual" is the starting point of Marx's philosophy. From
   the descriptions of the nature of human in Marx's Thesis for the PhD and
   "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844," to the initial concept
   formation of " Realistic Individual" in " Holy Family," and the last
   connotation on "Realistic Individual" in "German Ideology," we can
   conclude that Marx's thinking, questioning, exploring in human nature
   did not appear in a uniform appearance. According to Marx's above texts,
   this paper will examine the formation and the development of "Realistic
   Individual," in order to illuminate the unity of the stage and inherent
   in the historic development of Marxist ideology, and to reveal that
   Marx's ideology has been in the historical and logical unity.

AB Karl Marx's socio-economic analysis of capitalism and the conditions of
   industrial production are meant to imply the competitive alienation of
   workers in at least two important senses: (1) Workers are alienated from
   their tools and materials because under capitalism they generally do not
   own, develop or cultivate the means of production or market for products
   themselves; and (2) Workers are alienated from one another in
   competitive isolation prior to the evolution of assembly-line production
   in the classical progression of capitalist manufacturing. The present
   essay develops two main aspects of the art of alienation in this
   characteristically Marxist aesthetic directly influenced by Marx, as
   opposed to existential or atheistic among other kinds of alienation.
   Focus is placed on Marx's PhD dissertation and Philosophical and
   Economic Manuscripts of 1844, as a reflection of the state of social
   life, philosophical perspectives on the human condition, in a time of
   mechanization, consumerism and godless materialism. The history of
   artistic developments offers independent confirmation of Marx's
   thematization of alienation objectifying itself as a sign of the times
   in artistic production and aesthetic theory.

AB According to Sartre, some marxist ideas have been interpreted
   incorrectly by leaders such as Stalin, impeding the accurate application
   of Marx's ideas, leaving a bloodstain of violence in the historic record
   called "fraternity-terror": this is nothing more that the imposition of
   socialism by violent means. As such, the French existentialist resorts
   to Freudian psychoanalysis, to Kierkegaard's existential roots and some
   of his own philosophical concepts with the aim to restructure the
   execution of Marx's ideas, which resulted in failure at the beginning of
   the twentieth century. Sartre exposes the shortcomings of Marxists as
   well as the different causes that have led to capitalism being the
   dominant socioeconomic system. That said, capitalism has also
   dehumanised the individual by annihilating their subjectivity. In
   Sickness Unto Death, Kierkegaard conceptualises despair as a fatal
   sickness, which highlights man's need to fulfil himself subjectively.
   The Objective of this article is to carry out a hermeneutical study of
   the notion of despair according to Soren Kierkegaard, examining how it
   relates to the concept of subjectivity according to Sartre, Marx and
   some neo-Marxists, approaching some current critiques of Marx and
   Kierkgaards before arriving at Postmodernism through Slavoj Zizek; it
   aims to highlight the incongruences of Marxism and capitalism in the
   negation of subjectivity. The return to the existential concept of
   despair as understood by the Danish philosopher does not seek to
   identify coincidences with Marxist philosophy but instead seeks to
   reflect critically upon the meaning of subjectivity nowadays.

AB This article focuses on an important change in Chinese thinking of the
   20th century: the rebirth of Confucianism as the intellectual movement
   called "New Confucianism" which is considered in the China of today to
   be a possible substitute for Marxist ideology. But what exactly is the
   "New Confucianism"? The author first attempts to highlight the
   definition of Confucianism from the Western perspective and the problems
   that arise in that process. The study is based primarily on the work of
   Jiang Qing (sic), one of the principal thinkers of this movement of
   ideas, and on the analysis of the main western interpreter of Qing,
   researcher Daniel Bell. Further along, the paper discusses some of the
   most common tags of this movement: New Confucianism as a religion, as a
   social doctrine, and as a new political option for the future.
   Notwithstanding the elusiveness of the concept it appears to be the case
   that this movement is developing spontaneously in modern Chinese society
   and is gaining more and more followers, even via a lighter literary
   genre through which modified Confucian thoughts and tips for coping with
   everyday life can approach a wider crowd.

AB Otto Bauer (1881-1938) has emerged once more in the thought of Western
   Marxists. The dominant theoretical voice of the Austrian Social
   Democrats in the late Austrian-Hungarian Empire and the First Austrian
   Republic, Bauer was re-examined in the 1970s and '80s as 'the third way'
   was being explored in European politics by Eurocommunists. Bauer again
   is being discussed in the twenty-first century as not only a European
   'third way', but as a model for nations across the globe. Bauer's vision
   theoretically as well as tactically between 1919 and 1934, when Austrian
   fascism ended the political efforts of Austrian Social Democracy, was of
   a pluralist parliamentary governance that sought through party
   coalitions and the influence of social experiment a developing societal
   praxis whose socialist principles would realise eventually Marx's
   understanding of a classless society. A gradualism in long-range
   strategy and tactics would lead democratically to greater collective
   coexistence embracing differing cultures within and beyond separate
   nations. Reviewed here are five publications between 2005 and 2011 which
   are either thoughtfully supportive or critically dismissive of Bauer's
   multi-cultural models for the socialist coexistence of communities and
   nations. Two conference collections and three books on Bauer's thought
   and political life enable the contemporary mind to evaluate the seminal
   promise of Bauer's Marxist understanding, where for him Marxism was a
   social-scientific instrument to guide societal development.

   short, seeks to explain the legal phenomenon of the society, breaking
   both with legal positivism as with the natural law. The right is defined
   in its social structure, with the possible exclusion of essentialism of
   his analysis. Still, it seems that there is an essentialist assumption
   in thinking Miaille, both as a constituent of the holistic method, and
   by linking the right to social justice. Therefore, methodologically, the
   research will examine whether there is indeed an essentialist assumption
   in thinking Miaille and sequentially, the problem of essentialism in the
   light of Nietzsche's philosophy. From the performed analysis of critical
   philosophy of Nietzsche, the article concludes that the dialectical

   fails to seek to extract a possible truth of the social structure that

AB This paper situates the discourse of the Occupy movement within the
   context of radical political philosophy. Our analysis takes place on two
   levels. First, we conduct an empirical analysis of the 'official'
   publications of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) and Occupy London (OL).
   Operationalising core concepts from the framing perspective within
   social movement theory, we provide a descriptive-comparative analysis of
   the 'collective action frames' of OWS and OL. Second, we consider the
   extent to which radical political philosophy speaks to the discourse of
   Occupy. Our empirical analysis reveals that both movements share
   diagnostic frames, but there were notable differences in terms of
   prognostic framing. The philosophical discussion suggests that there are
   alignments between anarchist, post-anarchist and post-Marxist ideologies
   at the level of both identity and strategy. Indeed, the absence of
   totalising anti-capitalist or anti-statist positions in Occupy suggests
   that - particularly with Occupy London alignments are perhaps not so
   distant from typically social democratic demands.

AB The transformative ethos underpinning the Cuban Revolution aimed at the
   creation of the New Socialist Man as conceived by Che Guevara. This was
   to be achieved through the expansion of culture and education and the
   instillation of Marxist-Leninist ideology and philosophy of history. As
   a materialisation of history, monuments were considered as key devices
   for the reification and public spread of the official ideology. This
   paper explores how the Cuban Revolution generated a new public
   monumental aesthetic resulting from the competing demands of political
   commissioners and artists. It argues that artists sustained a hidden
   transcript of resistance by promoting abstract art, under the increasing
   pressure of the regime to develop a monumental public symbolic and
   material space following Soviet realist models. The paper focuses in the
   period of higher socio-cultural repression between the mid-1970s and the
   start of the Special Period in 1990.

AB Christian realism is a concept normally associated with the US
   theologian and ethicist Reinhold Niebuhr. However, Niebuhr was not alone
   in warning Christians of the dangers of utopianism and trying to promote
   a religiously inspired political realism; thinkers from a number of
   countries had similar aspirations. In this context, the Russian
   philosopher Semyon Liudvigovich Frank (1877-1950) deserves particular
   attention. A Marxist in his youth, Frank became disillusioned with
   revolutionary ideas before and after the 1905 revolution, and was drawn
   away from politics to philosophy. However, he remained interested in
   political questions, both while he was in Russia and after he was forced
   into exile in 1922. This found expression in the 1940s in a form of
   Christian realism. Frank rejected the doctrine the end justifies the
   means.' But he was a gradualist in his approach to social change,
   believing that politicians needed to have a pragmatic attitude of mind.
   A distinctive feature of Frank's approach was the connection he made
   between spiritual inwardness on the one hand and effective
   decision-making on the other, although he also saw spirituality as
   arising in a social context. Ultimately, there was a mystical dimension
   to Frank's Christian realism that was absent in Niebuhr's doctrine.

   limited to the practice of discourse, and is limited to a small academic

   textbook and not much Marx on philosophy to the practice of discourse,
   but with the natural revolutionary practice; discourse in current
   academic circles about the Marxist philosophy practice abound, but only
   words of practice and not have the real practice. The deeper reason for
   the dilemma of Marx's theory research is that the study of Marx's
   philosophy in contemporary China has both academic and ideological
   orientation. Academic understanding of the practice of both traditional
   epistemology orientation, theory of value orientation or body on the

   the subjectivity of the proletariat owes just as much to the Danish
   philosopher and theologian Soren Kierkegaard. Despite strong differences
   in their outlook, their accounts of subjectivity have strong structural
   similarities. For both, a division of the self against itself produces
   suffering that leads in turn to a growing consciousness of the roots of
   the problem; in the end, the self is restored through a relation to
   itself grounded in the absolute, and thereby becomes capable of freedom.
   Lukacs's theory of subjectivity is, thus, predicated on changing the
   orientation of the proletariat towards itself-in ways that are deeply
   indebted to the peculiar theology of Kierkegaard.

AB The article deals with the reception of Hegel's aesthetics in the
   philosophical community of State Academy of Arts in the 1920s. At the
   center of the discussion about Hegel in GAKhN is the problem of the
   ontology of art, presented by G. Shpet in his works. Under this ontology
   Shpet gives a non-metaphysical interpretation of Hegel's aesthetics.
   There, art is interpreted as an autonomous mode of cultural existence as
   "detached" or "aesthetic" reality. In characterizing this type of
   reality Shpet refers to two Hegel's definitions of art: (1) this reality
   is determined as an aesthetic "appearance" or "quasi-reality", in
   contrast to the pragmatic reality, and (2) this reality does not exist
   by itself and must be recognized by humans. Thus, there is some freedom
   in the definition of "aesthetic reality". Shpet's philosophy of art,
   based on the principles of Hegel's aesthetics, is an alternative to
   Marxist aesthetics which dominates at the turn of the 1920s-30s.

AB This paper offers practical guidance for empirical interpretation in the
   history of political thought, especially uncovering what authors meant
   and why they wrote what they wrote. I thus seek to fill a small but
   significant hole in our rather abstract methodological literature. To
   counter this abstraction, I draw not only on methodological theorising
   but also on actual practiceand on detective-work, a fruitful analogy.
   The detective analogy seeks to capture the intuition that we can
   potentially find right answers but must handle fragmentary evidence that
   different people can plausibly read in different ways. Placing the focus
   on evidence, and on combining different types of evidence, suggests that
   orthodox categories like contextualist' and Marxist' too often
   accentuate differences between scholars. This paper instead highlights
   core principles that unite usideas that underpin good textual
   interpretation across all schools of thought'.

AB Common notions of comparative philosophy tend to be strongly configured
   by the East-West axis. This essay suggests ways of seeing Latin American
   liberation philosophy as a form of comparative philosophy and an
   important Latin American thinker as being relevant for East-West
   political philosophy. The essay focuses on the Peruvian activist and
   intellectual, Jose Mariategui, who is widely regarded to have been a
   leading Marxist, liberatory, and decolonial figure in 20th century Latin
   America. Like many "Third World" intellectuals of the interwar years,
   Mariategui had an interest in decolonization struggles in Asia and wrote
   with some consistency on this subject and in ways that bear
   significantly upon key themes in his political theory. Since very little
   of this has received commentary, this essay begins a discussion of
   Mariategui's decolonial experimentation with ideas about Asia,
   decolonization, and indigenous cultural forms, like those of the Incas
   and Confucians. After some preliminary discussion of Eurocentrism,
   postcolonial thought, and decolonial thought, attention is focused on
   Mariategui's East-South geography of liberation, heuristic use of
   Chinese revolutionary politics, and Sinified hermeneutic for
   conceptualizing the consciousness of the Peruvian indigenous, a central
   element of his political theory.

   this relation is through the figure of Mao, whose concept of

   determinate negation. Although not going so far as to suggest that a
   certain combination of Mao and Spinoza would have enabled Althusser to

AB We here extend our previous contributions to a neo-Marxist sociology of
   health inequalities via an engagement with Roy Bhaskar's dialectical
   critical realism (DCR). We argue that Bhaskar's re-grounding of the
   philosophies of Marx and Engels has the potential to re-invigorate
   sociology's input into: (a) explanations of health inequalities and (b)
   interventions to reduce health inequalities. We also show that DCR
   provides rationale and opportunity for an action sociology beyond
   current professional, policy, critical and public sociologies. We
   briefly summarize current sociological models of health inequalities
   before protesting their lack of theoretical ambition. We then proffer a
   professional-cum-critical theory that emphasizes the continuing causal
   efficacy of social class in general, and of Britain's 'governing
   oligarchy' in particular, for any credible sociological account of
   health inequalities. Bhaskar's basic and dialectical critical realism
   are then introduced and the frame supplied by the latter commended for a
   deepening of the neo-Marxist theories of health inequalities being
   developed by us among others. The article concludes by drawing on this
   same frame to insist on a logical and moral commitment to an action
   sociology beyond any institutional constraints faced by practitioners of
   the discipline.

   developed from the Auden generation. The second section traces new and
   expanded international networks made visible through attention to
   anarchist rather than Marxist sensibilities. The third section considers
   the development of fantasy genre fiction based on the emergence of major
   authors from the antiauthoritarian literary networks outlined and as a
   continuation of the political transformation of activism to literary
   aesthetics and form. The conclusion anticipates coming expansions in the

AB The horizons for the modern study on Zhu Xi are pluralistic; while the
   Marxist and historical approaches are based on historical criticism,
   Chien Mu and Yu Ying-shih's historical approach is meant to explicate
   its historical rationality and solve contemporary cultural conflicts. Mo
   Zong-san approaches Zhu Xi through Kant's philosophy and the philosophy
   of mind to facilitate the further development of Confucianism, while Lo
   Kuang's scholastic approach, meaning to introduce Catholic philosophy
   into Chinese culture, is also an important dimension in the modern study
   of Zhu Xi. Alternating between the systematic and the historic
   methodologies, Lo Kuang strongly approved Zhu Xi's doctrine because his
   philosophical system of benevolence, theory of mind-nature and theory of
   moral cultivation. are supplementary to scholastic philosophy. Based on
   scholasticism, Lo Kuang redressed the problems with Zhu's philosophy:
   the conflicts caused by the dichotomy of li and qi, the insufficiency of
   essence as the criterion of good and evil and the inability to solve the
   problem with the cause of the individual being. Exploring deeply Lo's
   study of Zhu Xi and the possible approaches to assimilate Chinese and
   western philosophies, we could see how to understand Chinese
   philosophical frameworks creatively and promote the autonomy of
   contemporary Chinese philosophy.

   sociological theory of abstractive knowledge, and discuss the close
   connection between physiological, social, and economic aspects in the
   early sociology of knowledge. My discussion continues with an
   examination of Szende's differentiation between two economic effects
   within social epistemology: on the one hand the 'economy of thought' in
   the tradition of Ernst Mach, with its physiological, organic, and
   integrative functioning of knowledge; on the other hand, the
   socio-economic effects of social selection, exclusion, and societal
   antagonism. Besides the Marxist and more specifically the Austro-Marxist
   environment of Szende's writings, I trace the influence of the economic
   theory of Italian economist Achille Loria on Szende's understanding of
   the antagonistic nature of the transformation of knowledge. The paper is
   set at the intersection of philosophy of science and history of science.
   It relates epistemological issues to historical, social, and scientific
   developments in Szende's day and thus combines a philosophical analysis
   of Szende's sociological theory of knowledge with historical research
   into the natural, social, and economic sciences of his time.

AB The sociology of art as synthesized by Arnold Hauser is based on a
   theory of knowledge and articulates the cognitive role of art. In a
   brief analysis, this paper elaborates on the sources of this
   epistemological enterprise. The pedigree of Hauser's main thoughts was
   oriented towards a Kantian and Marxist framework, respectively. As a
   Kantian, he tried to take into account the philosophical consequences of
   two (or even more) different sources of cognition that are equal in
   value, correlative and necessarily cooperating. Giving exclusive
   priority to only one of these leads to classical philosophical errors
   such as psychologism and intellectualism. As a Marxist, Hauser was
   anti-dogmatic and anti-deterministic, because he adopted an
   interpretive-hermeneutical meaning of Marxism and considered it an aid
   against distorting tendencies in our thinking. His basic insight that
   the different sources of value-equal and cooperating cognitive layers
   are in an everyday-life perspective intertwined, so that a kind of
   reservatio mentalis is needed to methodically separate them for the sake
   of better understanding, makes him a distant relative of classical
   phenomenology. This web of epistemological investigations is what I call
   the multilayer theory of knowledge.

AB During the last quarter of the twentieth century, Soviet Russian
   philosophy did away with ideology in the fields of Science; but until
   the mid-1980s, scientists could not escape intense ideological scrutiny.
   A great number of Soviet scientists did their best to avoid this
   ideological supervision, and pursued their research, remaining neutral
   toward Marxist ideology. Among these fields of research were so called
   "philosophical problems of natural sciences" (The Western counterpart
   would have been the Philosophy of Science). Some Soviet Russian
   philosophers put forward original conceptions of scientific development,
   the structural features of science, and/or provided novel
   interpretations of certain scientific principles and ideas. These
   thinkers had deep roots in Marxism, though not orthodox Marxism. They,
   so to speak, overcame classical Marxism and proposed innovative ideas
   largely based upon epistemological considerations. The legacies of I. S.
   Alekseev and M. A. Rozov are especially worthy of attention for their
   original epistemological contributions to the philosophy of science.

   intertwined in Weil's reflections on the plight of workers. Based on a
   particular Marxist heritage, she problematizes oppression in a certain
   materiality of both the discourse and the bodies that move about in the
   scenario of the factory, a question that gives this thinking a relevant

AB The purpose of this article is to outline those essential distinctions
   of ethical socialism from a radical or left socialism, namely, not in
   the political plane, but in respect of development of "ethical"
   doctrines. Why the moral and legal aspect in philosophy of ethical
   socialism and as Kant's categorical imperative can enrich dialectic
   materialism, and also show why it is better to change social reality
   peacefully, instead of world revolutions, hat is so important.
   Proceeding from Cohen, Communism as telos (goal) of history unfolds
   through denying the existence of the rule of law and upholds the denial
   here of the possibility of revolution. Thus dialectical thinking seems
   to exclude the possibility of non-radical change through transformative
   steps of laws, and calls instead for a class polarization and structural
   violence, regardless of the empirical conditions where it is located.
   The very "unjustified" violence is contrary to moral principles and the
   categorical imperative. The categorical imperative, which dominates in
   thoughts of ethical socialists, is opposed to any unjustified violence
   and especially terror. This means that the revolutionary struggle of the
   proletariat is not legitimate because it is not consistent with some
   philosophical reasonable and predictable ideals, according to
   neo-Kantian socialists, but simply because It's only the struggle of the
   proletariat. In other words, the practical situation of the working
   class in the historical process legitimizes its existence and its
   struggle without any doubts. Habermas argues that Marx failed to see a
   person as an agent, which means the both a tool-making and "symbolizing"
   the animals, that is - labor and language are fundamental
   anthropological categories in the sense, that none of these categories
   cannot be reduced by one other. If you start to argue, then it means a
   return to the Hegelian - Marxist "error" and believe that "justice will
   inevitably turns to the extent that what should be", what history is -
   the judge and "happily appears" on the side of the proletariat. In our
   opinion we must first define and explain what is "proper" and truth,
   before class of proletariat could be justified. Critical ethics is
   logically prior and independent of historical development and such
   ethics prescribes that actually preaches "ethical socialism". The
   article also makes some parallels to universal prescriptivism of R. M.
   Soviet author Oleg Drobnicki which considers that they both tried in
   some sense to unify Kantian universalism, his main goal is not just
   changing concept of historical materialism, but to bring human dignity
   to agenda in Soviet ethics.

AB The ideology-theoretical turn' of the late 1970s and 1980s claimed a
   re-foundation of Marxist research into ideology, which was stuck in
   several respects. Its attempt to overcome the traditional fixation on a
   criticism of false' consciousness is still valid. It led, however, in
   particular in the tradition of the Althusser School, to an over-general
   notion of ideology that repressed the radical and critical impulses of
   Marx and Engels' concept of ideology. Going deliberately against the
   grain of a predominant tendency in secondary literature, which places
   Marx/Engels' and Gramsci's concepts of ideology on opposite poles of the
   spectrum, the essay shows that the strength of the respective approaches
   lies in their particular combination of ideology-critique and
   ideology-theory. The dichotomy of these strands is misguided and
   counterproductive and needs to be overcome by the renewal of an
   ideology-critique which is informed and backed up by a materialist
   theory of the ideological.

AB R.G. Collingwood was one of the staunchest intellectual opponents of
   Nazism in Britain throughout the interwar years and Second World War
   until his death in 1943. However, the ideological basis of his
   philosophical critique of Nazism is a matter of serious dispute among
   scholars. It has been described as liberal, Marxist and conservative.
   The aim of this article is to de-contest the ideological nature of
   Collingwood's critique. Through performing a philosophical analysis on
   the theoretical components that made up Collingwood's critique of
   Nazism, this article rejects the Marxist reading and argues that its
   ideological basis was both liberal and conservative. As a result, this
   article claims that, although the liberal and conservative readings can
   account for part of its ideological basis, by themselves both readings
   ultimately provide inadequate accounts of Collingwood's critique.
   Instead, it is only when taken together that the liberal and
   conservative readings are able to adequately account for the ideological
   nature of Collingwood's critique of Nazism. Indeed, this article
   demonstrates that the liberal-conservative basis of Collingwood's
   critique is a product of a broader tension between the two ideologies
   that runs throughout his political philosophy on account of his
   understanding of the dynamic nature of politics.

AB The ontological and analytical status of Marxian social theory has been
   a matter of fierce controversy since Marx's death, both within and
   without Marxist circles. A particular source of contention has been over
   whether Marxism should be construed as an objective science of the
   capitalist mode of production or as an ethico-philosophical critique of
   bourgeois society. This is paralleled by the dispute over whether
   Marxism ought to be considered a humanism (or critical theory of human
   agency) or a structuralism (or science of social systems). This article
   addresses both sides of this debate. The argument is that, rather than
   Marx's own social thought being split into incompatible poles, giving
   rise to 'two Marxisms', it forms a coherent unity. Marx's social theory
   is neither humanist philosophy, nor structural science, but is in fact
   realist science, which synthesizes these apparent antinomies, and
   thereby transcends both.

   and the historical context in which they emerged. It examines how
   Plekhanov's interpretation of Marxist philosophy was assimilated by
   Lenin. In the dispute between Plekhanov and Alexander Bogdanov Lenin
   took Plekhanov's side and in defence of Plekhanov wrote Materialism and
   Empiriocriticism. A major influence on Lenin was the correspondence
   between Marx and Engels published in 1913, which prompted him to study
   Hegel and other writers mentioned in the correspondence. Although
   Lenin's commentaries on Hegel and other philosophers were published as
   'Philosophical Notebooks', the notes Lenin made on the Marx-Engels
   correspondence were not, owing to Stalin's peculiar requirements of the
   Lenin cult.

   education. Due to different social development periods will form
   different ideologies, and therefore will produce different ideological
   content and value. China is a socialist-oriented country, and thus the
   Marxist ideological values and people-oriented value system are the
   socialist core value system. Therefore, the humanistic education
   reflects the people-oriented philosophy of education. This includes
   value-orientation of their own, user-friendly return, human promotion,
   and attention to human subjectivity. People in this education is to
   improve the quality of life in the expanded activities of social

   education appeared to reflect and reform of China's problems, the people
   of this education as the main ideological context for the development of
   China's education reform provides guidelines. Through analysis of the

AB The content of environmental education at any level of an educational
   system seems to be evident and universal because of the gravity of
   contemporary environmental challenges. However obvious differentiation
   of environmental knowledge is an unresolved issue both in educational
   practice and in philosophy of environmental education. The environmental
   education on the whole and ecology as a course at school or university
   are determined by technological, social, political, legal and cultural
   factors. Besides, environmental education and its philosophical
   foundation depend on actual peculiarities of a country development. The
   factors influencing philosophical reasoning about environmental
   education in contemporary Russia and revealed in the paper are the
   following: the reactualization of non-Marxist traditions in Russian
   philosophy, educational tradition of knowledge paradigm, socially
   inactiveness of Russians, depending on state decisions, bureaucratic

AB Importance of contemporary political philosophy has increased in recent
   decades. Since the 1970s, studies of Marx's theories have become an
   important part of the discussion within contemporary theories of
   justice. More extensive studies concerning Marxist political philosophy
   from multiple perspectives are becoming a focal point in other fields of
   academic research. "How to understand Marx's political philosophy?" has
   been a classic question for over a hundred years. Not an academic
   philosopher himself, Marx seems not to have issued a complete or
   consistent political philosophy by today's standards, so it is only
   natural that his views would be interpreted differently by different
   scholars. While it is justifiable for us to construct Marx's political
   philosophy, we must do it through a comprehensive theoretical
   reflection, and our construction must take full account of the history
   of the interpretations of Marx's political philosophy. This applies
   especially of his theory of justice-a history which has lasted for more
   than a century. It is even more important for us to reread the original
   texts, particularly Marx's early philosophical writings, and take them
   as the textual foundation for Marx's political philosophy.

AB The exchange of science and knowledge between capital cities has
   dominated research in recent decades. Imperial provinces have played
   only a minor role in recent works partly because as independent states,
   their histories are analyzed by other historians. In this article, I
   propose an alternative model to conceptualize and describe the contacts
   between both centers and provinces and between empires. Following ideas
   of Jurij Lotman, Andreas Kappeler and Moritz Csaky, I maintain that
   provinces and peripheries function as a necessary and constitutive
   moment in the intellectual geography of empires, and their interplay
   with the center prove essential for intellectual productivity. I discuss
   such processes as multicultural and multilingual exchange, including
   scholars defining themselves as Polish and Ukrainian, who helped to
   transmit new knowledge to imperial centers. I claim that the periphery
   is a privileged space for innovation, which is not constrained by the
   center's tight control, but instead subjected to manifold influences
   enabled though its heterogeneity. For instance, historiographically Kiev
   served in the 19th century as a center of innovation for the Russian
   empire. Similarly, John Stewart Mill's positivism was first discussed in
   Russian by a multilingual scholar of Polish origin, Baltazar Kalinowski,
   in St. Petersburg in the context of Polish (inner) Emigre organizations.
   Philosopher Henryk Struve, professor of Warsaw Main School, then
   Imperial Warsaw University, on the other hand, helps to visualize
   entanglements in the sphere of logic and history of philosophy. When
   Struve received his doctoral degree in Moscow, his controversial views
   sparked a debate over materialism, engaging several established and
   younger scholars. Also later, while predominantly writing in Polish, he
   published in Russian on contemporary philosophy and logic, presenting
   new insights from his western-peripheral position. Finally, while
   working in Graz, the Habsburg periphery, sociologist Ludwik Gumplowicz,
   of Jewish ancestry and Polish national allegiance, not only served a
   pivotal role in late imperial Russian sociology but also was cited in
   early Marxist works. Gumplowicz stands for manifold peripheries either
   though his Jewishness, his Anti-Clericalism and / or his scholarly
   position. Nonetheless, his sociology came to Russia by detouring through
   France, where it was popularized first by Rene Worms and his Institut
   International de Sociologie, a similarly peripheral institution, albeit
   located in the very center of Paris.

   Lenin and Jean-Toussaint Desanti but also to such successors as Pierre
   Macherey and Pierre Raymond. The thesis of the article is that
   Althusser's project to establish a philosophical practice that would be
   appropriate for Marxism did not simply consist of identifying and
   defending a 'materialist' position in philosophy against external
   'idealist' challenges or threats. On the contrary, it recognised that
   there exists an interminable struggle between inextricably linked but
   ever-shifting materialist and idealist tendencies a struggle that
   operates as a defining feature in the history of philosophy. As a
   result, the problem explored in this article concerns how best to
   conceptualise this struggle and to determine whether or not the term
   'tendency' genuinely holds analytical value and can serve as an
   important conceptual resource for Marxists working within the field of
   philosophy.

   book State and Evolution. Using the Cambridge approach, two basic
   historiosophical languages are highlighted: a) a neo-Marxist and
   simultaneously liberal language based on the central idioms of the
   "Asiatic method of production" and the division between private property
   and the state (i.e. "Eastern" and "Western" civilizations); b) the
   perestroika-informed historiosophical language of "choosing a path" and
   "historical alternatives". By combining these two languages, which
   demonstrate different answers to the question of predetermination and
   freedom in history, Gaidar offered a solution to the contradictory
   rhetorical dilemmas of justifying his course of reform in the context of
   the Soviet and Russian history.

   Also it provides the feeling of close continuance of the guiding idea

   philosophy. All this breaks off while stumbled upon lifeless coldness of

AB 'Neokantianism and Platonism' indicates an important issue of
   Neo-Hellenic Philosophy during the 1920s and the 1930s. The protagonist
   was Johannes Theodorakopoulos. His Heidelberg dissertation Platons
   Dialektik des Seins (1927) follows the Neokantian theories of judgement
   (of Emil Lask and Heinrich Rickert) and explores Plato's theory of
   judgement with emphasis on Philebos' categories of peras and apeiron.
   Theodorakopoulos' prolegomena to the Greek translation (1929) of Paul
   Natorp's Platos Ideenlehre are relevant here. Nevertheless,
   Theodorakopoulos developed a personal interpretation of Plato's
   philosophy and almost demoted the Neokantian interpretation, as is clear
   in his Introduction to Plato (1941, in Greek) as also in his Heidelberg
   Vorlesungen 1969 entitled Die Hauptprobleme der Platonischen
   Philosophic.
   Besides, other interpretations of Plato came forward. Evangelos
   Papanoutsos wrote his Tubingen dissertation Das religiose Erlebnis bei
   Platon (1926) under the supervision of Adickes. Konstantinos Georgoules,
   an earlier student of Husserl and Heidegger, published a translation of
   Plato's Politeia (1939, in Greek) with a rather philological
   introduction. The Marxist Demetres Glenos, an opponent of Neokantianism,
   proposed a realistic interpretation of Plato's Sophistes (1939, in
   Greek). Basileios Tatakes (an adherent of Henri Bergson) presented
   Plato's philosophy as a reconciliation of reason and mysticism.

   way of teaching / hegemonic relationship can not be neutral in relation
   to culture, but primarily as a producer of culture and vision of more

   clarification of what the author understood by organic intellectual and

   Marxist principle of totality to understand the intellectual activity.
   Given his conception of praxis category of intellectual gained another
   meaning. His definition of organic intellectual has become crucial to
   investigate the research of educational policies and not only
   educational policies themselves. In this sense, the educational policy
   is taken as a particular science, it deserves the same criticism that
   Gramsci does sociology and economics, ie, produces partial truths that
   must be re-appropriated as part of the entire research operated by the
   philosophy of praxis.

AB Seaford's recent work has revived and further substantiated a line of
   argument that had been developed by Marxist scholars claiming a central
   role for money in the genesis of philosophical thought. In a nutshell,
   this line of argument holds that beneath the abstractions in which
   philosophy breathes and with which philosophy works we can trace the
   real abstraction of the money form as embodiment of abstract social
   labour. Following this perspective, I will try to demonstrate the role
   money plays in Plato's Republic, focusing on Book I.

AB In this paper we explore the rise, during late francoism, of a
   philosophical avantgard; it emerged introducing an open break with
   everything resembling an academic ethos. The philosophical production of
   Fernando Savater and Eugenio Trias, who are the most prominent figures
   of this trend, are studied in an exhaustive way. We demonstrate the
   presence of a total -in the case of Savater- or a partial break -in
   Trias case- with academic philosophy, including the most modern
   tendencies (Analytical Philosophy, Marxist criticism). In Savater's
   trajectory the rupture is supported by the reading of Nietzsche provided
   by the French thinkers belonging to the College de Sociologie (Bataille,
   Klossowski), Cioran essays and the importation of Frankfurt Critical
   Theory. In constrast, the strategy deployed by Trias consisted in a sort
   of avant-garde transformation centered in the academic commentary of
   canonical texts. Trias use the structuralist method in order to change
   the traditional technique of text reading. The context of this processs
   is limited by important shifts concerning the political, religious and
   editorial fields. The methodological background of this research is
   supported by Pierre Bourdieu sociology of intelectual fields (Fabiano,
   Pinto, Boschetti), the sociology of philosophical networks and ritual
   interactions chains (Randall Collins) and the microhistorical analysis
   of "philosophical constellations" (Dieter Henrich)

AB In my talk I intend to consider the feenbergian proposal of technology
   transformation, in search of a path of equal distance (a) from the
   heideggerian approach which takes technology as Gestell (framing),
   nature as a standing reserve and the technological civilization as a
   fate, imprisoning mankind in the huge system created by man himself, (b)
   from the Analytic Philosophy approach which takes technology as an
   application of science and thinks the Philosophy of Technology in the
   extension from the Philosophy of Science, taking it as a know-how and
   searching to circumscribe the practical syllogism (action rule) which
   establishes the ties between knowledge, artifact and action, and (c)
   from the traditional Marxist approach, which takes technology as a
   productive force and thinks Philosophy in the extension of Economics,
   thus, as something neutral, either as a machine or as a tool =
   instrument. In his intellectual course, Feenberg seeks the elements to
   rethink the nature of technology in the Critical Theory, finding them in
   the praxis categories, such as totality, instrumental reasoning,
   dialectics, etc., and introducing a tour de force to get rid from
   Adorno's atavist pessimism and Marcuse's romantic optimism. Moreover,
   maintaining the Frankfurtian inheritance, Feenberg will align to the
   perspective of the empirical turn which characterizes an important
   segment from the nowadays North American Philosophy of Technology, as
   well as the so called Social Studies of Science (SSS), in which
   Technology was added later, having the Social Constructivism and the
   French School (Bruno Latour) as his main interlocutors. The focus of the
   paper will be the empirical turn, marked by the search of empirical
   support in the philosophical considerations about the Socio-Technical
   systems (case studies, etc.) as well as the challenge of avoiding the
   Philosophy of Technology to be carried by the Sociology/Anthropology of
   techno-sciences.

AB The question concerning the connection of scientific inquiry to
   democratic praxis is central to both Antonio Gramsci and John Dewey.
   They share a common philosophical origin in Hegel and are essentially
   both in the tradition of Left Hegelian thought. Likewise, their
   respective analyses of the forces obstructing democratic emancipation
   were sharply focused on the distortions of social life caused by
   economic agents cooperating under hugely unequal power relations. As
   Gramsci wrote from his prison cell from 1929 to 1937 in Italy, Dewey
   went through his most fruitful philosophical period in the United
   States, including his writings on politics and democracy. They both
   found targets of critique by diagnosing the pathologies of public life
   resulting from the power of private capital interests in collusion with
   a co-opted representative body, the authoritarian crimes and attendant
   culture of fascism, and the theoretical rigidity of the Soviet Marxists.
   In addition, true to their Hegelian roots, they marshaled their
   critiques of the abstractions of liberalism and its attendant moral and
   economic theory by insisting on the embedded, cultural, and historically
   deep contexts in which emancipatory practice need take place.

   chosen as an interpretive conduit Gianni Vattimo's reading developed in
   his last nihilistic hermeneutics. This reading joins the most recent
   attempts to develop a "left-wing Heideggerianism," but its achievement
   is reengaging in a dialogue with Nietzsche and the Hegelian-Marxist

   in dialogue with some theorists who lie in a marxist theoretical
   framework: Evgeni Pachukanis, Michel Miaille, Alysson Leandro Mascaro,
   Michael Lowy, Anselm Jappe, and Marx himself. Indeed, it will show that
   the thought of Karl Marx, far from not considering the law, laid the
   groundwork for a critical theory of liberal ideology that insinuates
   itself in the writings of Rawls: though he brings the principles of
   justice, and is defined as "egalitarian liberalist," the liberal ethics,
   with rational individuals capable of choosing the best options and
   reject social inequality essentially from a moral perspective, is
   present in his work. The aim of this paper is to dig for the
   inconsistencies of the concept of original position and thus raise it to

AB The paper examines modern sociology the experience of which enriches
   social epistemology and philosophy of science. The problem of a
   universal, general theory is very hard do deal with, though it had
   emerged as early as in the epoch of Enlightenment. The paper discusses
   whether a general theory is possible and a methodological role played in
   its creation by "middle range theories", that is the approach proposed
   by American sociologist R. Merton. The methodological structure of
   Marxist theory, traditionally seen as "the general theory", is under
   critical scrutiny. Another aspect of sociological methodology
   development is G. Ritzer's ideas of "an integrated sociological
   paradigm" and also of "a multiply paradigm science". This approach is
   used to analyze "a degree of generality" of sociological theories. J.R.
   Searle's interpretation of the nature of facts in social sciences, where
   facts may get an objective status because of an agreement between
   members of society, is also discussed. On the whole, the paper comes to
   the conclusion that philosophical and methodological problems in the
   cognitive experience of modern sociology are diverse and important.

AB The history of concepts is a complex discipline. It has no status of an
   independent subject in the high school curriculum, yet it tries to grope
   its place among such well-established disciplines as etymology and
   history of ideas, history of philosophy, history of culture. The history
   of concepts is subject to all the risks and has all the possibilities of
   interdisciplinary heuristics. In the era of the rule of biology, natural
   sciences and economics, the history of concepts is suspected of
   speculation, uncertainty and worthlessness. It cannot be a source of
   utilitarian express-information due to its diachronic and abstract
   nature. By 'concept' I mean a certain spiritual concept covering the
   full complex content of the word, which is a keyword or basic concept of
   the history of ideas, culture and society, i.e. spiritual history, for a
   specific long or short period of time. The history of concepts explores
   genetically-semantic, historical processes of formation and
   transformation of these keywords. Such studies include not only
   descriptive, but also significant reconstructive and sometimes
   speculative, and some deliberative components. The longer the concept
   exists, the more 'unfounded' and 'fathomless' it becomes. In the
   immediate vicinity of the history of the concepts there is the history
   of constructs, the history of ideas, historical concepts, the history of
   discourse, discourse analysis, historical semantics, semantic of
   cultural studies, cultural linguistics, keyword research, etc. Surely,
   we must consider linguistic sciences as well: onomasiology, synonyms,
   antonyms, phraseology, and so on.
   fBut if Germany regularly publishes collection of works on the history
   of concepts, in Russian this branch of the Humanities is in its infancy,
   for several reasons. 1. The initial discipline, from which the history
   of concepts originates, is philosophy. However, Russia has got a very
   poorly developed philosophical tradition. The fate of philosophy and
   religious philosophy in the Soviet Union is well known, while the
   genuine history of concepts requires uncensored work with sources,
   broad-based knowledge, the freedom of thought, and rejection of
   ideology. 2. Many other important scientific branches of history of
   spiritual life in Russia, and later in the Soviet Union, could not
   progress properly. Classical philology and jurisprudence, which are
   important for the development of the history of the concepts, survived a
   'catastrophic decline' after 1917. There was no solid foundation for the
   Roman law in Russia, which affected the assimilation of concepts and
   moral values of personalism. The Marxist-Leninist historical science
   after 1917 was based on the ideological system of coercion, which, of
   course, destroyed theology and history of religion. The freedom of
   thought could only exist in the internal emigration. 3. Russian and
   Western linguistics primarily studied etymology, semantics, lexicology,
   phraseology and terminology, rather than the classic history of the
   concept. The formal models of descriptive linguistics, mathematical
   linguistics and computer science are even more remote from the history
   of concepts. 4. The scientific schools of literary studies such as
   formalism, structuralism, rhetoric, narratology, deconstruction,
   absurdism and others do not make the slightest contribution to the
   history of concepts. Nowadays among the most attractive branches of the
   Humanities is the theory of mass communication, communication strategies
   or Iconic Turn (eye turn). The regulatory methods are far more popular
   than the sense-making approaches like the history of concepts. 5. The
   history of Russian concepts is even a greater complexity due to the
   bilingual Russian verbal culture, i.e. the Russian-Church Slavonic
   diglossia that existed before. Besides, in a certain period of Russian
   history, there was the Russian-French-Church Slavonic triglossia, at
   least among the Russian educated elite, to say nothing of numerous
   borrowings from Greek, Latin, Dutch, Italian, German, and English. The
   Russian language is overloaded with borrowings, calques and
   international words, which often entail the transfer of concepts. 6. The
   Russian language is characterized by the doubling of concepts. This
   phenomenon is not widespread in Western languages (compare
   'svoboda'/'volya', 'pravda'/'istina', 'mir'/'svet', 'uzkiy'/'tesny'
   etc.).
   However, despite all mentioned above, the Russian history of concepts
   offers a wealth of material: it could have collected more extensive
   sources and make it available. It must be acknowledged as the inevitable
   difficulty that Russian concepts are in tense relationships with the
   semantics of the word and the text; that being borrowed from other
   languages, they are often insufficiently defined and seem to be in
   limbo, hovering between the poles of meaning and opinion. What Russian
   science really lacks in this field is fundamental large-scale projects,
   like the historical dictionary of philosophy, or the dictionary of basic
   concepts as well as special editions such as the archive of the history
   of concepts. The Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) should undertake
   corresponding obligations and promote the fundamental long-term projects
   in this area. Only in this way the foreseeable future can bring the
   standards of western historical and conceptual studies and address the
   issues of transfer of concepts and the comparative history of concepts.
   A great historian Sergei Solovyov said, "We are Europeans, and European
   values are not alien to us".

AB During the 1960s, the "exchange" between Louis Althusser and Italian
   Marxist philosophers developed around the theme of the autonomy of
   Marxism. Harmony between the theories of Althusser and Galvano Della
   Volpe (and his students) was short-lived, and there was a definitive
   break around the relationship between science and ideology. The chief
   intermediary for introducing Althusser's thought to Italy was Cesare
   Luporini, a philosopher and an active member of the Italian Communist
   Party who brought For Marx and Reading Capital to Italy. Althusser's
   grappling with Gramsci was constant, and after the critiques of
   historicist Marxism, the author of Prison Notebooks came to hold
   influence over the French philosopher with regard to political matters.
   As Althusser's thought developed, considerable weight was also held by
   the reading, mediated by Gramsci, of the works of Niccolo Machiavelli,
   which consolidated his relationship with Italian political and
   philosophical culture. Althusser managed to catch a glimpse of the
   philosophical significance of the Gramscian conception of reality as
   relations of forces (the philosophy of praxis) beyond the historicist
   and humanist schema within which he had enclosed Gramsci in Reading
   Capital. But his reading of Machiavelli would develop in the direction
   of so-called aleatory materialism, also because to Althusser (for
   deeply-held political reasons: his attachment to classism and to the
   division of the world into two adversarial camps), the Gramscian
   category of hegemony would always remain extraneous.

   recognise the continued relevance of Marxism to such discussions. I note
   that crucial aspects of MacIntyre's politics and philosophy,
   particularly his opposition to capitalism, are now integral to the
   contemporary debate which helps in generating a shared vision of radical
   politics. Nevertheless, I point out that key disagreements still remain
   as to the role of Marxism within such debates, the validity of
   MacIntyre's critique of Marxism, as well as the potentially problematic
   post-Marxist practice that MacIntyre advocates in After Virtue and

AB Choice has been built into Systemic Functional Linguistics from its
   beginning. It has a specialized technical meaning in SFL not to be
   equated with its sense in philosophical and sociological discourses.
   However, many of these other senses of choice form cultural contexts for
   the SFL-term, and some of these contexts will be addressed in an
   exploration of their significance for acts of evaluation as a necessary
   prerequisite for human agency.
   We shall start by discussing unproblematized notions of the freedom of
   choice of the autonomous individual as represented in a popular essay by
   David Foster-Wallace (2012). These notions will be criticized in the
   spirit of the critique of the notion of Subject2 by Foucault (1966), and
   of sociological work by Bourdieu (1979) on habitus in modern societies,
   both of which cull the notion of the autonomous individual very much
   into question. We shall then turn to attempts to defend the notion of
   the Subject and of choice by locating its roots in key elements of Greek
   philosophy and their further development in both Christian and
   post-enlightenment materialist and Marxist reasoning (Habermas, 2008).
   For systemic linguistics, the notions of choice and of the value-systems
   upon which choice needs to be based (Halliday, 2001) are crucial for
   motivating the concepts of activity and social agency, so essential for
   an integrated sociolinguistic theory (Hasan, 2009).

   Yellow River, the principal contradiction of the Yellow River is less
   water and more sediment, different sources of water and sediment, and
   uncoordinated water-sediment relation. The source of healthy life crisis
   of the Yellow River is that the relationship between human and the
   Yellow River are demanded. It is the inevitable result of human moving
   forward along the track of industrial civilization. Therefore, the
   Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) formally proposed the new
   river training concept of maintaining the healthy life of the Yellow
   River, made it as the ultimate goal of the scientific development and
   management of the Yellow River, and started to build the corresponding
   river training systems. In this paper, the basic tenets of Marxist
   dialectical materialist view is applied to make speculation and
   interpretation on maintaining the healthy life of the Yellow River from
   the perspective of the system theory philosophy. Philosophical ontology,
   epistemology and axiology of maintaining the healthy life of the Yellow
   River, which is also analyzed. For the current practices of scientific
   development and management of the Yellow River, the proposal of re
   -understanding of the Yellow River, in-depth study of the Yellow River
   and more respect for the Yellow River are studied and proposed.

   theory development in general and development of cognition in particular
   in terms of possible deviations from previously dogmatic assumptions of
   Marxist-Leninist philosophy.
   Basing on informational concept of criminal procedural evidence, the
   authors study objective laws of obtaining cognitive materials by
   detectives, investigators, judges and developing corresponding images
   that reflect facts to be substantiated. Authors consider current
   achievements in philosophy, psychology, psychophysiology and
   neuropsychology.
   The achieved results let the authors justify two main methods of
   criminal procedural cognition - verbal and non-verbal and define certain
   trends in criminal procedural investigation theory development. The
   trends may become methodological basis for studying nature and aspects
   of certain types of investigation.

AB Study of the classic texts of Marx and Engels should employ two
   perspectives: Marxist philosophical history and Marxist philosophical
   principles. The two cannot be separated, still less contradictory. In
   dealing creatively with these classic works, we must firmly uphold the
   methodology of historical materialism, read them in accordance with the
   authors' original intentions and approach them creatively. We need to
   oppose research styles that place undue emphasis on the researcher's own
   interpretations and constructions. Research on Marxist philosophy should
   develop on the basis of respect, study and correct understanding of Marx
   and Engels' classic works; different readings of these texts must not be
   allowed to construct a pluralist Marxism. This is of great importance
   for consolidating the leading position of Marxism in the sphere of

AB The paper is devoted to the life of faithful Orthodox believers in the
   Soviet Russia. Whereas the majority of similar works are focused on the
   relations between the state and the church, the paper is aimed at
   outlining the way of life of ordinary believers in the 1930s by taking
   the Kazan diocese as an example. Various sources of information,
   including archive data, the 1930s local media, the researches of
   regional and national historians, were used in the study. The research
   embraces the period between 1929 and 1940. The author analyzes the life
   of priests' families, including persecutions from the state for
   belonging to clergy (expulsion from educational institutions,
   difficulties in entering schools and in getting employment or access to
   collective goods). The author pays attention to urban believers' life,
   focusing attention on negative attitude to religion in general and to
   believers specifically (for instance, the idea of closing Christian
   churches with the following demolishing of buildings was a widespread
   question of the meetings at plants and factories). The paper also
   examines rural believers' life and distinguishes two groups of
   believers: migrants to cities (who were restricted in expressing their
   religious position) and those who stayed in the villages, felt more
   freedom in expressing their religious position and could face the legal
   power in an open conflict. Special attention is paid to the fact that
   under the Soviet power religious life was expelled from official life
   and restricted to domestic rites. Only in the rural areas was it
   possible to defend religious views in numerous groups (for instance, 200
   people left the collective farm as a protest against shutting down the
   local temple, whereas in the cities such a protest could be expressed
   only by single believers). The author concludes that the Soviet policy
   affected religious aspect of life of all social groups; the
   Marxist-Leninist philosophy was incompatible with religious way of life;
   such incompatibility resulted in the persecutions and repressions of the
   believers; religious life went into deep hiding and was mostly
   restricted to domestic rites.

AB This text focuses on the last part of the theoretical production of Leon
   Rozitchner, in which he assesses the structuring myth of our culture:
   Christianism. By means of a Freudian interpretation of Saint Augustin's
   "Confessions", Rozitchner retakes in an original way the Marxist idea of
   criticism of religion as the presumption of every criticism. The
   religious core hidden by modern secularization, hindered by capitalism,
   is revealed, and the notion of a corpus emerges, which allows critical
   revision of ancient dichotomies beset by religion, in order to open
   paths towards new ways of telling History. From the perspective of
   historical materialism, we try to put forward the passage from criticism
   of ideology to criticism of mythology. The latter promotes a reflection
   on the symbolic foundations that may give way to emancipatory processes.
   Finally, we show that in Rozitchner's work, the will to construct a
   theory of the subject and the criticism of culture is the result of a
   perennial reflection on identity in itself.

AB It is widely accepted that Sheldon Wolin has revitalized the tradition
   of radicalism in the context of modern political thought, as evidenced
   by his contribution to the debate on the so-called death of political
   philosophy and his forceful critique of Rawls and modern political
   liberalism. However, Wolin's fugitive democracy has met with opposition.
   This paper investigates fugitive democracy from a Marxist perspective
   and questions whether fugitive democracy can actually confront crucial
   socio-political issues such as the lack of democracy for the masses in
   the production of social wealth. Moreover, Wolin's misinterpretation and
   rejection of Marx's theory of democracy and politics leads him to a
   misconceived view of the Marxian philosophy of history and the progress
   of political societies as a whole, a misconception that leads to
   inconsistencies within his own work. And finally, although Wolin seems
   to be a radical democrat and appears to hold a worldview close to that
   of socialists, he in fact, despite his criticisms, follows a liberal
   logic.

AB A central thesis of Karl Polanyi's The great transformation concerns the
   tensions between capitalism and democracy: the former embodies the
   principle of inequality, while democracy represents that of equality.
   This paper explores the intellectual heritage of this thesis, in the
   'functional theory' of G.D.H. Cole and Otto Bauer and in the writings of
   Eduard Bernstein. It scrutinizes Polanyi's relationship with Bernstein's
   'evolutionary socialism' and charts his 'double movement' vis-a-vis
   Marxist philosophy: in the 1910s he reacted sharply against Marxism's
   deterministic excesses, but he then, in the 1920s, engaged in
   sympathetic dialogue with Austro-Marxist thinkers. The latter, like
   Bernstein, disavowed economic determinism and insisted upon the
   importance and autonomy of ethics. Yet they simultaneously predicted a
   law-like expansion of democracy from the political to the economic
   arena. Analysis of this contradiction provides the basis for a
   concluding discussion that reconsiders the deterministic threads in
   Polanyi's oeuvre. Whereas for some Polanyi scholars these attest to his
   residual attraction to Marxism, I argue that matters are more complex.
   While Polanyi did repudiate the more rigidly deterministic of currents
   in Marxist philosophy, those to which he was attracted, notably
   Bernstein's 'revision' and Austro-Marxism, incorporated a deterministic
   fatalism of their own, in respect of democratization. Herein lies a more
   convincing explanation of Polanyi's incomplete escape from a
   deterministic philosophy of history, as exemplified in his masterwork,
   The great transformation.

AB Modes of dialectical reasoning were introduced into International
   Relations (IR) from the 1980s onwards in the context of the
   post-positivist debate as an alternative intellectual resource drawn
   from the philosophy of the social sciences. To the extent that the
   deployment of dialectics for IR drew upon Marx and the wider Hegelian
   Marxist tradition, it was challenged philosophically and substantively
   on two fronts. Philosophically, the problem emerged how to disassociate
   dialectics from the 'systemic' Hegelian legacy, which expressed itself
   in the naturalism and monism of dialectical materialism, and how to
   overcome a reading of capital as a self-unfolding conceptual category,
   expressed in systematic dialectics, which de-historicised and
   de-subjectified capitalism as a social relation. Substantively, the
   problem remained how to anchor a Historical Sociology of international
   relations in a historicist philosophy of praxis to avoid the temptation
   of a relapse into structuralist modes of explanation. By addressing this
   double challenge, this paper identifies a central lacuna within the
   Marxist IR tradition-the gap between general Marxist theories of IR and
   the analysis of foreign policy-making. This gap persists in equal
   measure in the bifurcation between the fields of general IR theory and
   actor-specific foreign policy analysis (FPA). For general IR
   theories-Marxist and non-Marxist-tend to deploy structuralist versions
   of theory, which relegate the problem of foreign policy-making to
   lesser, possibly non-theorisable, forms of inquiry. FPA is thereby
   demoted and subsumed under wider structural imperatives capable of
   cross-case generalisation. The paper moves from a critical exposition of
   the wider debate in IR and FPA of attempts to close this gap, via a
   critique of dialectical materialism and systematic dialectics, to a
   re-statement of the dialectic of the concrete. It concludes with a
   reconsideration of how dialectical thinking may bridge this gap by
   incorporating foreign policy as the crucial site for the active drawing
   together and re-articulation of multiple influences from the domestic
   and the foreign into a Historical Sociology of international relations.

AB In this introduction, I argue that in spite of recent discussions of
   global and neoliberal time, the anthropology of modern time remains
   under-explored. Modern time here is understood to be a complex
   historical product. At its centre is the abstract time-reckoning of
   capitalism, which acts as a universal measure of value, but which always
   comes into conflict with concrete experiences of time. Its social
   disciplines emerge from Christian practice, but the ethics of these
   routines are marked as secular and universal. Its politics is founded on
   representations of the natural connections of communities through a
   homogeneous historical time. Its science and technology tightly link
   social, human time to external non-human rhythms. It is important for
   anthropologists to reflect on modern time because our discipline has
   been profoundly influenced by the discoveries of its depth, secularity,
   and relativity. The controversies that emerged in relation to Darwin's
   and Einstein's insights still provide the framework for many of our
   theories, especially when we draw on phenomenological philosophy. In
   this introduction, I suggest that the key resources for overcoming this
   significant absence in anthropology lie in a rapprochement between
   Alfred Gell's epistemology of time and the approaches of Marxist
   political philosophers. This combination, along with an emphasis on the
   labour in/of time, gives rise to new questions and reveals new aspects
   of modern time in the present.

AB Deleuze and Guattari, in What is philosophy? (1991), expose their Image
   of Thought; they consider that it is possible to think through three
   disciplines: Philosophy, Science and Art. In all this structure there is
   no trace of Politics: why is it absent? We cannot try here to make a
   "Marxist" distinction between theory and practice, thinking that
   Philosophy, Art and Science are part of the thought and therefore of the
   theory, while Politics is placed on a different level, which would be
   that of action and practice. Thinking in Deleuze and Guattari is act, it
   means to face the chaos, it means to experiment; their constructivism
   removes all doubt on the fact that Thought and Action can be given on
   two totally distinct plans. Politics is therefore, according to Deleuze
   and Guattari, within the Thought, and since it cannot be located either
   in science or in art, in my opinion it is entirely ascribable to
   Philosophy. However, Philosophy and Politics cannot completely identify
   themselves. In fact they do not identify themselves even in Deleuze and
   Guattari: Philosophy is creation of concepts; Politics is within
   Philosophy because it is also creation of concepts, but the difference
   between the two disciplines lies in the type of concepts that they
   create. The concept says the event - this is its nature and remains
   unchanged whether we speak of philosophical concept or political
   concept; the difference lies rather in the type of event being
   announced. In fact, Philosophy says the event that is in becoming, it
   says the "actual", to use a term dear to Foucault, and the becoming and
   the actual are distinguished from past and present, but also from
   future. In fact in What is philosophy? Deleuze and Guattari write that
   only when a utopian element is present, then Philosophy becomes
   political and carries to the maximum degree the critic of its age. So
   the becoming is doubled: there is an actual becoming, which is the
   specific object of the philosophical concept, and then there is a
   becoming that looks to the future, which is the basis for the political
   concept. Politics can connect Philosophy with its time, and can produce
   a critique of the present only because Politics looks beyond this
   present and has in mind a better future and "a new people and a new
   earth "- as Deleuze and Guattari say - and this is its Utopia. So it is
   worth asking if to make political philosophy today may mean creating new
   concepts, which contain this utopian element, that is, concepts that
   privilege the dimension of the future, in addition to that -
   specifically philosophical - of the becoming.

BP 893

PD 2014

AB The concept of freedom has been understood differently in antiquity.
   Thus, in the classical Greek world, freedom belongs only to a few
   individuals. In Athens, only free citizens were considered truly free
   and not slaves and foreigners. Linguistic history of the word "freedom"
   demonstrates its origin in the society of slave owners. In such society
   only the master is free, slaves, women and children, over which he
   reigns are without freedom.
   Over time, every ideology claimed that defends and promotes freedom,
   which, however, they understand completely different one by each other.
   A classic conservative sense of freedom differs from that of a
   traditional liberal, for example.
   Eastern Christianity claims that God's absolute freedom belongs to Him
   absolutely, on Which depend all, without Himself depend on something,
   God Himself restrict His freedom to His "absolutes" created beings. As
   being "in the image and likeness" of absolute and uncreated God, man is
   called to partake of absolute freedom, which is itself God's freedom.
   The only difference of human freedom to the divine is that first there
   isn't by nature, but by participation in divine freedom. Condition of
   participation in this freedom is communion with God, which is achieved
   by keeping the commandments. Otherwise, by transgressing commandments,
   man break his communion with God and subject to decay and death and stop
   to see God as a Father who loves him and builds gods who mastered him.
   One of the concepts through we characterize the modern world is
   undoubtedly the freedom. The original freedom, which is essential to man
   was perverted by forefathers sin. Nowadays man has become a slave of
   sin, of falsehood and illusion. However, the original freedom of the
   human being was not totally canceled. Contemporary secularized man feels
   God as an enemy of freedom. Thus, in hegeliano-marxist dialectics we
   have the report between Master and slave; Freud talks about the complex
   of "sadistic father" which incite to patricide, while for Nietzsche, God
   is " the celestial Spy" whose view hinders; moreover, Proudhon said that
   "God is the evil " and the atheist syllogism on the relationship between
   freedom and God spoken by Balcunin and resumed by the existentialist
   philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre is: "If God exists, I am not free; I am
   free, so God does doesn't exist".
   Therefore, today, human freedom exists, but the notion of freedom being
   misunderstood, the ideal of freedom toward man aspires is not the
   revealed one, but one invented by man. In the following lines I will try
   to present the differences between what has meant the concept of
   freedom, over time, in the various philosophical currents and what
   represents the concept of Christian freedom.

VL 108
IS 2
BP 1
EP 16
PD 2014
PY 2014
AB This article attempts to provide a new look at an old idea within
   Marxist discourse. Reification, as first imagined by Marx and later
   Lukacs, describes a process by which capitalism transforms human beings
   and social relations into things. Although the concept has been
   subjected to much abstraction and reinvention over the years, this
   article attempts to address a foundational problem that has remained
   unsolved since its inception: Close analysis reveals that the concept of
   reification has never been developed to include an example of an
   alternative or non-reified state of being. To solve this foundational
   problem, I look beyond Marxism and to the phenomenology of Maurice
   Merleau-Ponty. For Merleau-Ponty, the body is our primary vehicle for
   being-in-the-world, but what makes his philosophy unique is his emphasis
   on embodied subjectivity, as well as his dialectical conception of
   corporeality and being-in-the-world. From this view, the social and
   material worlds can best be understood as dynamic realms of
   intersubjectivity, while sentient beings always exist as subjects prior
   to the reifying effects of capitalism. Building upon an ongoing
   dialectic between the ideas of Marx, Lukacs, Merleau-Ponty and others, I
   will ultimately reframe the concept of reification as a objectifying
   tendency, precipitating from capitalism's ability to obscure the lived
   experience of the phenomenal body.

AB Purpose - To defend the thesis that the base-superstructure hypothesis
   central to Marxist theory is also central paradigm of the tradition of
   Critical Theory. This is in opposition to those who see this hypothesis
   as determinist and eliminating the possibilities for the autonomy of
   social action. In doing so, it is able to retard and atrophy the
   critical capacities of subjects.
   Design/methodology/approach - Emphasis on the return to a
   structural-functionalist understanding of social processes that places
   this version of Critical Theory against the more domesticated forms that
   consider "discourse ethics" and an "ethic of recognition" as the
   normative research program for Critical Theory. Also, an analysis of the
   purpose and logic of functional arguments and their relation to Marx's
   concept of "determination" is undertaken.
   Findings - The essence of Critical Theory hinges upon the ways that
   social structures are able to deform and shape structures of
   consciousness of modern subjects to predispose them to forms of
   domination and to view the prevailing hierarchical structures of
   extractive domination as legitimate in some basic sense.
   Research limitations/implications - The foundations of Critical Theory
   need to be rooted in a renewed understanding of the relation between
   social structure and forms of consciousness. This means a move beyond
   theories of social practices into the realm of social epistemology as
   well as the mechanisms of consciousness and their relation to ideology.
   Originality/value - Few analyses of the relation between the base and
   the superstructure or material organization of society and the
   socialepistemological layer of consciousness delineate the mechanisms
   involved in shaping consciousness. I undertake an analysis that utilizes
   insights from the philosophy of mind such as the theory of
   intentionality as well as the sociological approach to values through
   Parsons.

AB This review assesses the strengths and weaknesses of Peter Thomas's
   long-awaited study of The Prison Notebooks, based on his extensive
   research and philological reconstruction of the critical edition. I
   distinguish three senses in which the 'moment' in the book's title can
   be understood: as the historical moment around 1932 in which Gramsci
   proposed the outline of his distinct brand of the philosophy of praxis;
   as the moment or momentum that still lies in wait for a future research
   programme in Marxist philosophy; and as a methodological principle for
   understanding the dialectic as a theory in which entities such as state
   and civil society but also coercion and consent, far from allowing the
   kind of Eurocommunist or post-Marxist instrumentalisations in which they
   are seen as part of a chain of binaries, are actually moments of a
   unified larger structure that in Gramsci's work comes to be associated
   with the idea of the integral state. This impressive reconstruction of
   Gramsci's notebooks, however, also reveals some major lacunae, above
   all, in terms of the lack of attention given to Gramscian developments
   in the non-European world, in places such as India or Latin America.
   This omission is all the more surprising given the longstanding
   tradition, particularly in Latin America, of viewing Gramsci as a
   theorist of the integral state more so than of hegemony.

AB In The Gramscian Moment Peter Thomas fundamentally revises the
   'textbook' Gramsci - a theorist whose work centred on a primordial
   East/West distinction, focused on the superstructure, and upon the ways
   a ruling class secured subaltern consent to its rule. Placing special
   emphasis on the Notebooks from 1932, Thomas critiques readings of
   Gramsci by Perry Anderson and Louis Althusser, and finds that Gramsci
   articulated the 'philosophy of praxis' not so much as a synonym for, or
   declaration of independence from, Marxism, but rather as a tendency
   within Marx's legacy that Gramsci hoped to make hegemonic within the
   working-class movement. Two friendly amendments emerge with respect to
   this persuasive account. First, the emphasis on Gramsci's philosophy
   leads the author to an over-simplified account of the role of
   evolutionary theory within Gramsci's own perspective and privileges
   'philosophy' over other fields to which Gramsci's vision was even more
   decisive. Is the 'Gramscian moment' really best analysed by looking at
   those intellectuals commonly deemed philosophers? And second, does not
   this moment also entail a more fundamental rethinking of the orthodox
   concepts and methods of revolutionary-left historiography than the
   author sometimes implies?

AB Peter D. Thomas's book The Gramscian Moment: Philosophy, Hegemony and
   Marxism draws us to reflect on a point that Gramsci's interpreters have
   often neglected: the particular structure of the Prison Notebooks, i.e.,
   the ways in which the text was constituted and, dependent on that, the
   fundamental methodological criteria for its interpretation. Thomas's
   book is a consummate synthesis between the deep and detailed study of
   the Notebooks text and the need to reconstruct some order within;
   between close historical-philosophical assessment and theoretical
   proposal within contemporary Marxist (and para-Marxist) debate.
   Consequently, this book confronts us as Gramsci's present-day readers
   with a task that no-one can face alone, but that is nonetheless
   extraordinarily urgent: the task of intervening in the debate within the
   post-modem and post-Marxist Left so that the link between Marxism and
   philosophy is resumed, starting out from Gramsci himself. In short: a
   revival of Marx through Gramsci, through in turn a return of the
   philosophy of praxis as Marxism for our own day.

AB This is a review-essay on William Haver's recent translation of three
   essays by Nishida Kitaro in a volume entitled Ontologies of Production.
   Nishida is one of the founders of the famous Kyoto School of philosophy
   and, while his philosophy is not really Marxist, Haver attempts to bring
   Nishida into dialogue with Marx in his Introduction and through his
   selection of essays to translate. I attempt to situate Haver's
   translation in a brief discussion of a recent debate on how to write
   modem Japanese intellectual history and, through this examination, I
   suggest a framework for analysing modem intellectual history drawing on
   the work of Harry Harootunian, Moishe Postone and Jacques Bidet. In
   short, this framework attempts to relate the production of ideas to the
   temporal dynamic associated with capital, the commodity-form and other
   related mediations that make up the modem global capitalist system. Then
   I turn to Haver's Introduction and translations and both explain some of
   the key concepts of Nishida and show how, using the framework that I
   outlined, Nishida's work can be conceived of as failing to understand
   its own conditions of possibility in the multiple mediations of
   capitalism. For this reason, Nishida's work, like many other romantic
   critiques of capitalism, criticises the abstractions of modernity at an
   abstract level, failing to account for the mediations of capitalism such
   as class and the commodity.

AB This article defends the claim that the philosophical aspect has been
   seriously underrated in the scheme of the conceptualization of
   contextual societal forces shaping education systems. The rise of
   neo-Marxist paradigms since the 1970s has resulted in a disproportionate
   emphasis on social and economic systems as factors shaping national
   education systems. However, empirical research has recently rendered
   evidence regarding how philosophical frameworks shape children's way of
   viewing the world and how they think. This article provides examples of
   this. Such philosophical and/or conceptual differences need to be
   factored in the design and planning of education systems. Some
   implications have been outlined regarding an expanded view of the role
   of philosophy and/or life-concept for the planning and development of
   education systems and for comparative education as afield of scholarly
   research.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to offer a theoretical framework
   for applying Web 2.0 technologies and design principles to the
   development of participatory cultures within libraries. A participatory
   culture is one that focusses on facilitating interaction and the
   creation of content by users rather than the consumption of content
   created or compiled by experts.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study is a literature-based
   theoretical analysis that explores the role of libraries as agents of
   cultural hegemony and techniques for developing socially responsible
   library praxis. It combines insights from a variety of discourses
   including Western Marxist theories of hegemony, critical theories of
   library and information science, professional literature regarding
   "Library 2.0" service models, and media studies theories of
   participatory culture.
   Findings - Libraries do not just organize knowledge; they construct it.
   Furthermore, these constructions tend to reinforce dominant discourses
   while marginalizing others. By adopting participatory technologies and
   design principles, libraries can support greater diversity of expression
   and create spaces for marginalized discourses.
   Practical implications - This paper offers suggestions for applying
   principles of participatory culture to the design of library services
   such as collection development, cataloging and classification,
   reference, instruction, and institutional repositories.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a conceptual framework for
   understanding and evaluating the significance of Web 2.0 for library and
   information science by applying theoretical perspectives from other
   disciplines.

PY 2014
AB This discussion study takes as its starting point the thinking, which
   Professor Smajs and others presented in Filosoficky casopis 6, 2013 on
   evolutionary ontology. The author shows an enduring aspect of
   evolutionary ontology: ontology as the product of human culture attains
   to knowledge that has the seeming character of objective truth it thus
   expresses the true nature of the ontic order of nature. This is not,
   however, the usual nonsense of inconsistent philosophy. The author of
   the text identifies as lying behind this step Kantian and Hegelian
   strategies which make possible this shift from the order of culture to
   the order of nature. These strategies are (i) a sign of the grounding of
   Professor Smajs' ideas in early-modern thinking; and (ii) they are the
   cause of a strongly anthropocentric attitude, which unwittingly
   influences the system of evolutionary-ontology At the end of the study,
   the author points to the fact that it would be more appropriate for
   evolutionary ontology if its proponents were able to give up their
   early-modern argumentative approach, and thus rid themselves of their
   strong anthropocentrism. In this way they would be able to avoid the
   conceptual conflict which makes evolutionary ontology "frozen" from
   within.

AB Manuel Sacristan Luzon (1925-1985) was a logician, epistemologist and
   unorthodox philosopher -PSUC-PCE militant during many years-who had an
   essential role in the reintroduction of the Marxist-communist tradition
   in our country at the end of the fifties. He proposed, during the last
   years of his life, a strong revision of the communist ideology after May
   68 and the annihilation of the Prague Spring. He also concentrated on
   the irruption of environmentalism. His proposals for a politics of
   science oriented in a socialist way, and close to the technoscientific
   tradition which is not blind but which is critical of the new romantic
   conceptions inspired in the work of Heidegger-about whose gnoseology he
   wrote his doctoral thesis-are still proof of the lucidity and
   penetration of his thought. He always fought for an (emancipatory)
   passion that is anchored in reason and in scientific information, in the
   commitment towards the most disadvantaged groups in the Earth, and in
   the practice of a creative and humanist philosophy.

AB In this article I discuss Polanyi's intellectual formation in early
   twentieth-century Budapest and in 19205 Vienna, focusing in particular
   upon his relationship to Guild Socialist and Marxist theory and to
   Austrian Social Democracy. It was a period in which Marxism was evolving
   rapidly, and Polanyi was too. In his twenties, he reacted forcefully
   against what he saw as the evolutionary and deterministic traits of
   Marxist philosophy. In his thirties, his relationship to Marxism
   underwent a 'double movement': his long-held doubts about Marxism
   crystallised into an forceful critique, swiftly followed by a
   sympathetic dialogue with the ideas and politics of Austro-Marxism, the
   'Rousseauian' commitments of which were not unlike his own. I examine
   Polanyi's relationship with Marxism in each of these phases, and explore
   the affinities between Guild Socialism and Austro-Marxism. The final
   section introduces the distinctly un-Polanyian analysis of Austrian
   Social Democracy offered by Polanyi's wife, Ilona Duczynska.

AB This paper sketches out the contours of the philosopher G W F Hegel's
   geographical thought. Until now, geographers have shown little interest
   in Hegel's geographical writing. He has figured minimally in histories
   of geography, and critical geographers who have engaged with Hegel have
   done so indirectly, either through Karl Marx's work or through Marxist
   and postcolonial scholars' readings of Hegel. This paper offers a more
   direct reading. It begins from an understanding of geographical thought
   as both an intellectual and a practical endeavor with its own distinct
   historical geographies. It examines Hegel's concepts of 'nature' (Natur)
   and 'space' (Raum); his understanding of geography's relationship to
   history and anthropology; his relationship to Carl Ritter and Alexander
   von Humboldt; and the significance of 'territory' in his political
   philosophy. It highlights the ambiguity that characterized Hegel's
   thinking about geography, especially in his discussion of climate's
   influence on humans. It also challenges Henri Lefebvre's reading of
   Hegel's view on the state's relationship to territory. Finally, it
   suggests that Hegel's conceptions of nature, space, and geography
   mattered not only for his philosophies of history, nature, and
   subjective spirit, but for his understanding of modernity's geographies
   as well.

   The idea of "individual" Paladino focuses in his work on is placed in

   faith in the magical power. Along this route Paladino meets Ernesto De

   With the same naturalness he makes coincide his sign with those of
   Matisse and Beuys, overlaps conceptually Spinoza to Jarry, Giordano
   Bruno to Beuys by getting the common trait in the transgressive
   dimension. It would be misleading trying to get a unitary route at all
   costs because only in the idea of the "encounter" apparently causal,
   that recalls the impracticable and audacious routes of Hegel's
   Phenomenology of Spirit, we can get the meaning of the Paladino's
   contaminations with philosophy.

AB Eighteen years experience of teaching medical anthropology at a
   Hungarian medical school offers insight into the dynamics of
   interference between the rationalist epistemological tradition of
   biomedicine as one of the central paradigms of modernism and the
   cultural relativism of medical anthropology, as cultural anthropology is
   considered to be one of the generators of postmodern thinking. Tracing
   back the informal "prehistory" of our Institute, we can reveal its
   psychosomatic, humanistic commitment and critical basis as having
   represented a kind of counterculture compared with the technocrats of
   state-socialist Hungary's health ideology. The historical change and
   socio-cultural transition in Hungary after 1989 was accompanied by
   changes in the medical system as well as in philosophy and in the
   structure of the teaching of social sciences. The developing pluralism
   in the medical system together with the pluralism of social ideologies
   allowed the substitution of the dogmatic Marxist-Leninist framework with
   the more pragmatic and empiricist behavioral sciences including medical
   sociology and medical anthropology. The conflict between the initiation
   function of the hard preclinical training of the first two years, and
   the reflective, relativistic and critical narrative on "biomedicine as
   culture bound entity" constructed by medical anthropology during the
   second year of medical training is discussed. We also submit our
   fieldwork data gained as a result of a two year investigation period
   focusing on diverse initiation types of "would be" physicians. The main
   proportion of our data derives from individual semi structured deep
   interviews together with focus group interviews carried out with medical
   students of upper years. Finally, the role of medical anthropology in
   the "rite of passage" of becoming a medical doctor is summarized, paying
   attention to their field work reports and the risks and gains in this
   process.

   theories, sceptical views and continuous information society theories
   are distinguished. Second, an alternative concept that is grounded in
   Hegelian philosophy and Marxist political economy is presented. The
   basic argument is that the emergence of transnational informational

   that informational capitalism is just one of the forms of capitalism
   that co-exist today. There is a unity of diversity of capitalism(s).

AB The senses are relationally produced through, in part, the everyday
   activities of making urban space. This reciprocal relationship suggests
   new ways of exploring the conditions of possibility for an urban
   politics. In seeking to chart such possibilities, we turn to the twofold
   understanding of aesthetics found within Marx's critique of political
   economy, using this as a lens through which to learn from the practices
   of insurgent artists and anarchitects as they perform relational urban
   interventions' in the cities of London and New York. Just as Marx railed
   against the anaesthetising tendencies of capitalist society, and saw
   within communism the possibilities for the liberation of the senses and
   the freeing of creative activity, so relational urban interventions
   develop a twofold aesthetic model. Nevertheless, recent scholarly
   attempts to consider the political life of sensation and to theorise the
   relationship between space and politics have been filtered through a
   post-Althusserian lens that is less attentive to emergent possibilities
   within critical spatial practice. Taking a different tack, we call for a
   philosophy of praxis that builds on an understanding of relational
   sensuousness and a Marxist aesthetics in order to prise open the
   conditions of possibility for an urban politics.

   Thus, ideology is essentially an omnipresent entity, which knows no

   games are capable of reflecting ideological stances in a variety of
   ways. Throughout the first part of this article, we will revisit
   ideology from a Marxist perspective, that is, as a form of deception,
   manipulation, and enslavement and subsequently by moving away from such
   a deterministic/fatalistic approach and discussing it in the light of
   Gramsci's theory of hegemony. By providing practical examples, this

   years after his arrival, in the mid-50s, conflict between him and the
   communist leaders and their SED party escalated due to opposing views on
   the conceptof freedom. There were further disagreements on the role of
   the subject in history and the (un-)importance of utopianism. Following
   the escalation he was politically and academically isolated, which led
   to his leaving the country in 1961. But his philosophy of hope was kept
   alive in the GDR, especially in oppositional circles. Thus one can find
   elements of his utopianism in works of dissidents such as Rudolf Bahro,
   Wolfgang Harich and Robert Havemann.

AB One of the traditional branches of Western practical philosophy, Marxist
   practical philosophy, is still the mainstream philosophy in contemporary
   China. It provides not only a new understanding of human nature, mind,
   behavior, and environment, but also an alternative perspective for the
   study of psychology. It is from this perspective that activity theory in
   the former Soviet Union and "practice" discussions in China try to
   integrate Marxist practical philosophy with psychology. Based on these
   attempts, we advocate the introduction of "practice" into psychology and
   the understanding of all psychological problems as starting from
   "practice." First, "practice" is defined as people's creative activity
   and a way of human existence. The structure of "practice" is then
   divided into three hierarchies: reflexive practice, cognitive practice,
   and social and cultural practice. Finally, two examples are chosen to
   explain how to research psychology from the viewpoint of Marxist
   practical philosophy.

AB Marxism in Contemporary Russia How can we describe the status of both
   Marxian and Marxist research in post-Soviet Russia in the last decade?
   Marxists still have an audience; they are part of the political
   philosophy of contemporary Russia, but their works enjoy very limited
   attention. The school that deserves most attention is that of "critical
   Marxism", whose leader is the economist A. V. Buzgalin, which aims at
   representing the contemporary form of Marxism. It is close to the
   sociological approach of the political science theorist B. Y.
   Kagarlitsky. This critical Marxism is ruthless towards the Soviet era,
   but also tough on contemporary capitalism. The problems adressed by the
   philosophy of history and of theory of culture receive an original
   treatment in V. M. Mezhuev. More globally, contemporary Marxist
   researches, however vehement in their criticism of the Soviet period,
   use Marxist concepts to study current social issues, both in Russia and
   in the world in general.

AB Feminist philosophers and philosophers drawing on the German tradition
   of social philosophy have recently converged in stressing the importance
   of the concept of reificationfirst explicitly discussed by Gyorgy
   Lukacsfor the diagnosis of contemporary social and ethical problems.
   However, importing a theoretical framework alien to Lukacs' original
   discussion has often led to the conflation of reification with other
   social and ethical problems. Here it is argued that a coherent
   conception of reification, free of implausible Marxist and idealist
   trappings, can be recovered from Lukacs' original discussion of it: the
   socially induced distortion of experience such that what is in fact
   human action appears as mere natural happening. This phenomenon is to be
   distinguished from, firstly, instrumentalising objectification of
   persons and, secondly, person-identification failure, with which Martha
   Nussbaum and Axel Honneth respectively have equated reification in
   recent work. Reification, on the understanding of it recovered here, is
   problematic not just because it is an illusion, but also because it can
   render moral reasons for action or omission, and grounds of ethical
   evaluation, invisible to agents, and, moreover, because it can lead
   people to tolerate as inevitable undesirable situations which could in
   fact be changed. It can thus ground social criticism.

AB A high degree of syncretism is achieved between Marxism and physical
   situation of Chin's revolution & construction in localization of Marxism
   in China. On this basis, a road adaptive to China's social development
   is constructed. Localization of Marxism in China not only provides
   everlasting theory for social construction and political development in
   China, but also has a direct influence on development of numerous
   fields, including philosophy, literature and historical research.
   Therefore, localization of Marxism in China is a permanent motivation
   for China's progress. In recent years, there are plentiful and
   substantial achievements in research on localization of Marxism in
   China. Considerable achievements have been made both in research
   techniques, objects of study and research perspective. All these
   achievements lay a more solid foundation for development of Marxism in
   China. Exploration and analysis of theoretical research achievements of
   localization of Marxism in China with a new perspective by using the
   theoretical method of text and narrative pattern can result in a deep
   understanding of its theoretical connotation and key points. In
   addition, this kind of exploration and analysis can also provide a new
   referential mode for practical significance and motive force of
   development of Marxist theoretical research achievements.

AB In this paper, I will describe the history of Japanese science studies
   (In the Japanese language, the term "science studies" [Kagaku-ron] is
   used to indicate a broad area, which covers the history, philosophy, and
   social studies of science and technology.) from the beginning of the
   twentieth century to around the mid-1980s, and will argue how
   depoliticization took place in its history. Japanese science studies was
   formed under the conspicuous influence of German philosophy before World
   War II (hereafter WW II), especially in its neo-Kantian tradition.
   During the military regime, science studies offered a hiding place for
   Marxists. However, after the end of the Asian-Pacific War, British
   influence became stronger in the history and sociology of science in two
   stages. First, logical positivism arrived, in this case, mainly from the
   USA under the name of "analytic philosophy." Second, the American
   influence was furthered by the introduction of Kuhn's theory of paradigm
   which unexpectedly depoliticized Japanese science studies. This trend
   seems to have reflected the course of the Cold War. After the Fukushima
   Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, one of the most significant legacies of Cold
   War Science, we need to review the history of science studies in order
   to retrieve its "critical" function. Even though this paper focuses on
   Japan, comparable reflections should be made worldwide.

AB Kracauer's rehabilitation in the 1990s sidelined his Marxist framework
   of the middle-to-late Weimar era in favour of the then still dominant if
   decaying paradigms of poststructuralism and postmodernism. It was also
   silent on the relationship between Kant and Marxism in Kracauer's work.
   This essay addresses these weaknesses by arguing that Kracauer
   transcoded the structure of Kant's 'problematic' around reification into
   a Marxist framework in the middle-to-late Weimar period. The essay
   considers how Kracauer conceived the mass ornament (photography and film
   especially) as a site of reification and critical pedagogy. It explores
   his strategies of de-reification and their overlap with Walter Benjamin
   and the ruptures and continuities between the radical Weimar work and
   his later Theory of Film. The essay argues that the Theory of Film can
   be better understood as a transcoding of Kant's philosophy of the
   aesthetic in the third Critique into the film camera itself, although
   the Marxian framework of the Weimar period is now considerably
   attenuated.

AB Inspired by Louis Althusser's polemic that Marxism is a science and not
   a philosophy, we enquire about the nature of this 'scientificity' of
   Marxism. The result is a clarification that Marxism is a social theory
   within the discourse of hermeneutics. Drawing on William Dilthey's
   categorisation of human science as Geisteswissenschaft, which
   essentially is an interpretive science when differentiated from
   Naturwissenschaft, we point out that Marxism should be understood and
   used as a socio-hermeneutic theory. We highlight that at the pinnacle of
   his intellectual development that resulted in Das Kapital, Marx produced
   a scientific principle for interpreting historical social formations and
   the human condition, particularly during the capitalist epoch. The
   description of the scientific character of this hermeneutic principle,
   set against what Althusser attempted, and motivated by the quest for a
   contemporaneous application of Marxist theory, is the mission of our
   paper. It is a contribution to the Philosophy of Social Science.

AB From 1919 to 1929, the great Hungarian Marxist philosopher Georg Lukacs
   was one of the leaders of the Hungarian Communist Party, immersed not
   simply in theorising but also in significant practical-political work.
   Along with labour leader Jeno Landler, he led a faction opposing an
   ultra-left sectarian orientation represented by Bela Kun (at that time
   also associated with Comintern chairman Zinoviev, later aligning himself
   with Stalin).
   If seen in connection with this factional struggle, key works of Lukacs
   in this period - History and Class Consciousness (1923), Lenin:A Study
   in the Unity of His Thought (1924), Tailism and the Dialectic (1926) and
   'The Blum Theses' (1929) - can be seen as forming a consistent,
   coherent, sophisticated variant of Leninism. Influential readings of
   these works interpret them as being ultra-leftist or proto-Stalinist
   (or, in the case of 'The Blum Theses', an anticipation of the Popular
   Front perspectives adopted by the Communist International in 1935). Such
   readings distort the reality. Lukacs's orientation and outlook of 1923-9
   are, rather, more consistent with the orientation advanced by Lenin and
   Trotsky in the Third and Fourth Congresses of the Communist
   International.
   After his decisive political defeat, Lukacs concluded that it was
   necessary to renounce his distinctive political orientation, and
   completely abandon the terrain of practical revolutionary politics, if
   he hoped to remain inside the Communist movement. This he did, adapting
   to Stalinism and shifting his efforts to literary criticism and
   philosophy. But the theorisations connected to his revolutionary
   politics of the 1920s continue to have relevance for revolutionary
   activists of the twenty-first century.

   teachers from China were categorized as being in the multiplist

   is innate or fixed than did the samples from Singapore and China. The
   results of the current study further implied that, on the one hand,
   different educational philosophies (i.e., Democratic Western philosophy
   versus Marxist materialism) may have an influence on beliefs about

AB A preliminary impact study of a university, school and private sector
   partnership project: hope for disadvantaged students through mentorships
   Successful access to higher education for black students in particular
   remains a challenge to all tertiary institutions in South Africa. This
   is the opinion of Prof Russel Botman, Rector of Stellenbosch University
   (SU). It is therefore of concern that the SU strategic framework
   document (SU 2010a) states that the increase in our country's student
   population projected by the National Commission for Higher Education in
   1997 (DBO 1997) has not been attained. This is in contrast with the
   University's vision for the future, which commits itself to an academic
   institution of excellence and a respected knowledge partner that
   contributes towards the development of South Africa and welcomes a
   diversity of people and ideas. But according to a report by the Centre
   for Higher Education Transformation (CHET)(1) little demographic
   transformation had occurred in respect of who participates in higher
   education. This is an indication that black students,chances of gaining
   access to university have in fact decreased.
   Despite this authorities continue to insist that the percentage of black
   students in public higher-education institutions be increased. The
   Ministry's vision is of a transformed, democratic, non-racial and
   non-sexist system of higher education that will promote equity of access
   and fair chances of success to all who are seeking to realise their
   potential through higher education (DBO 1997). The Vice-Rector of SU
   (Fourie 2009b:16) expands on this: "Besides the moral-ethical
   considerations, pressure is also being placed on universities by higher
   education policy to diversify their student and staff compositions and
   to remove measures that could exclude certain groupings".
   Stellenbosch University is thus under pressure to align its diversity
   profile with the transformation goals set by the government, as
   proclaimed in the White Paper on Higher Education of 1997. At the same
   time the University also experiences pressure from the broader community
   to answer to the call of alleviating poverty in disadvantaged
   communities (SU 2010a). However, the standard of teaching in previously
   disadvantaged schools in the surrounding areas is such that very few
   students qualify to further their studies at university level. The
   question therefore is what the University can do to draw students that
   will rise to these challenges. In his response the University announced
   a strategy referred to by the current vice-chancellor (Botman 2007) as a
   "pedagogy of hope". This seems to have been inspired by the neo-Marxist
   Brazilian educationalist Paulo Friere's publication Pedagogy of the
   oppressed (1970). According to this strategy the University will search
   for and exploit opportunities that will lead to "the farm owner daughter
   and the farm worker,s son sitting in the same class" (Botman 2007).
   This gave rise to initiatives such as the Rachel's Angels Schools
   Partnership Project, which is based on the principles of community
   interaction.(2) The project aims to build the capacity of promising
   students from disadvantaged communities with the aid of a mentorship
   programme. This will enable them to bridge the gap between school and
   university successfully. This article presents an overview of the
   project as well as a report on its impact. The educational theories
   which underpin the Rachel's Angels project can be considered to be
   constructivist in nature, founded upon a philosophy that is student
   centred and based on a view in which knowledge is not absolute, but is
   actively constructed by the student. The study aims to establish whether
   the project has achieved the desired outcomes. If employed successfully,
   SU will give effect to its transformation agenda, which includes
   increased participation by a diverse corps of students, willingness to
   react to social and economic needs and growing cooperation between
   higher education institutions and all sectors of society. The results of
   the impact study indicate that, despite growing pains, the project has
   already made a meaningful contribution in building the capacity of
   disadvantaged students. The implications for the University are to
   continuously engage in partnerships with previously disadvantaged
   schools in order to unlock the potential of disadvantaged students. Not
   only will it reflect positively on the University's diversity profile,
   but at the same time give meaning to the University's quest for a
   "pedagogy of hope".

AB This is a vast and vague topic. In order to do justice to it one has to
   write a book or maybe more than one. For it can be understood in quite
   different ways and on different levels For example you may think mainly
   of the historical aspect, that is how philosophy of science developed in
   the last hundred or so years and how its influence on education changed;
   you may think of quite different schools of philosophy, from Marxist or
   positivist to such exotic but at some places influential philosophic
   positions like that of Rudolph Steiner; of course, you may limit the
   subject to special fields like epistemology, theory of scientific
   methodology, or, what has become fashionable recently, sociology of
   knowledge which may have a considerable bearing on physics teaching
   (Collins and Shapin 1983; Jung 1985). Again we may think of the topic
   treated by a philosopher, a scientist, an educationalist, a teacher,
   which would mean quite a difference. I am trying here to speak as an
   educationalist, with the physics teacher in mind: this is my vocational
   perspective as someone who educates physics teachers. Of course, our
   main concern is the contribution of science, especially physics, to
   general education, which integrates many of the special topics
   mentioned. Philosophy of science comes in because it is not at all clear
   what science and physics is, and what of it should be taught, and how
   such chosen parts should be taught. I also take this opportunity to give
   an idea of the longstanding tradition of this discussion in Germany,
   connected with names like Wagenshein, Litt, Heisenberg and many others.

AB The discipline of history and the New South Africa - should South
   African history be re-written?
   History is a discipline of humanities which records and analyses past
   events. It is a narrative or chronicle of human endeavour and experience
   in time. Constant change is an intrinsic characteristic of all forms of
   history. Traditional cyclical views of history have long ago been
   replaced by a linear cognisance and presentation of past events in a
   chronological sequence, implying a beginning and an expected fulfilment.
   This means that previous individuals, societies and developments are
   unique. Consequently, the question arises whether it is of any use to
   acquire a thorough knowledge of past events and achievements. A
   qualified YES would be the appropriate answer.
   Change is a paradoxical idea. It is the notion of alteration combined
   with the notion of remaining the same. According to Michael Oakeshott
   change is nothing other than inherent continuity. One should distiguish
   between the past as such and written history. The historian must rely on
   multiple voices of the past, sometimes called representations of
   pastness. Such evidence of the past may be found in written documents,
   oral recollections and artefacts. The historian can never truly know the
   complete reality of the past. It is the historian's duty to reveal
   existing myths and to convey to the world what they discover about past
   reality in order to promote the legitimate use of history and check the
   abuse of this vital human science.
   From the explanation of historical scholarship mentioned above it seems
   unfair and unnecessary to ask whether South African history should be
   re-written at the commencement of the twenty first century In the
   re-writing of South African history new issues, challenges and
   opportunities must always be addressed within the context of our
   particular time and environment in a responsible manner In present day
   South Africa historians are faced with a complex, fragmented and
   heterogeneous rainbow nation. A truly South African identity is in
   continuous development. This requires constant re-interpretation,
   revision and re-writing of history, based on all available and
   accessible sources. Each generation is bound to write its own history.
   Today the wheel of history has undoubtedly turned, due to fresh and
   challenging questions asked by a new generation.
   During the previous century four distinct phases of South African
   history developed, namely English orientated liberal history, Afrikaner
   nationalistic history, Marxist radical history and Africanist
   nationalistic history. Today the re-interpretation of South African
   history demands a new perspective of the South African position within
   the global household. In a multi-cultural society each group will have
   to maintain its own particular or private history to appreciate its own
   identity. Such individual histories may subsequently contribute to a
   more general and balanced history of South Africa. During the past two
   decades van Aswegen's History of South Africa to 1854, Liebenberg en
   Spies' South Africa in the Twentieth Century and Giliomee and Mbenga's A
   New History of South Africa attempted to re-interpret our past. Such
   representative histories can never be final. The result will always
   remain open and incomplete. A multi-perspective approach to the past
   seems to be, however, the most acceptable and appropriate focus on the
   vast and intricate background of South Africa's unique population.
   A few guidelines may serve the purpose of achieving a comprehensive
   history of South Africa in our present situation. We need to take
   account of the different prevailing traditions and perceptions of past
   reality in our communities. We must avoid a tunnel vision in our
   research approach and appreciate the fact that South Africa is an
   integral part of the world at large. In a truly democratic society
   historical consciousness and knowledge will provide essential qualities
   to a vibrant community life and responsible citizenship. The teaching of
   history at all levels must be promoted by well trained and enthusiastic
   teachers and lecturers. The reading culture of society must be supported
   by well stocked libraries and the availability of electronic media.
   Newspapers, radio and television must stimulate critical thinking about
   the past. Cultural museums and heritage sites must constantly remind
   people of their common roots and proud ancestors. Thus the history of
   South Africa will be constantly re-assessed and re-written, not because
   previous historians produced poor histories, but because the context
   within which their histories were written, has dramatically changed.

   Imre Lakatos' life in Hungary before his flight to England following the

   political functionary under Hungarian Stalinism, and compiles what is
   known of Lakatos' role in the induced suicide of a young woman, Eva
   Iszak, at the end of World War II. This historical and biographical
   study provides essential background for appreciating Lakatos'
   cross-cultural role as a philosopher in England and Hungary, through the
   Anglo-American philosophy and the Hegelian-Marxist traditions in which
   he was trained and did not leave behind.

   the theory and history of archaeology and its development in Central
   Europe. His view of the discipline differs in many ways from that of
   current global trends. His 'artefact archaeology' inverts the concept of
   adaptation and highlights the role of artefacts in the creation of the
   human world. The interview also shows that post-war archaeology even to
   the east of the Iron Curtain followed the trajectory from
   culture-history paradigm to processualism and onwards. It also testifies
   to the situation in the social sciences under the Communist regime and
   the ambiguous role of Marxist philosophy.

   Marxism in educational philosophy. Each register contains insights but
   also contradictions that cannot easily be resolved through internal
   modifications of the theory or through theoretical synthesis with other
   registers. The radical function of Marxist pedagogy is to create a
   constellation of Marxisms through which the outline of history can
   emerge. As such, the author ends with a new emphasis in Marxist
   education on the exacting imagination of the teacher which creates a
   constellational image of concepts and theories all of which hang in a
   precarious and historically specific configuration.

AB Adam Schaff, the prominent philosopher of the contemporary Poland has
   profoundly deepened our knowledge about semantics, semiology,
   epistemology and the sciences of man in general as well as language. His
   novel and original interpretation of Marxism paves the new way to our
   understanding of East European Neo-Marxism. For him Marx's early
   writings which deal with human individual and alienation, constitute the
   core of a new brand of humanism. According to him, the Marxian thought
   can be epitomized as the radical, militant, integrative, optimistic and
   even scientific humanism. It is not only different from Sartre's
   abstract existentialism, but also opposite to Althusser's anti-humanist
   structuralism. This article firstly introduces the readers to the basic
   ideas of language, knowledge and semantics presented by Schaff. It
   discusses then Marxian concept of alienation in social relations and the
   role of human individual by the invention, internalization and
   application of language. Further, this treatise elaborates Schaff's
   analysis of the possibility how each and every individual can achieve
   his/her happiness and emancipation through human creativity and
   self-realization. Apart from supporting Marxist violent class struggle,
   Schaff did not reject the peaceful social evolution, especially social
   reform and parliamentary democracy as an alternative means to the
   transformation of society. In conclusion, the Marxist tradition of the
   unity of theory and praxis is manifest in Schaff's concern with the
   severe predicament of human beings in the present-day world and the
   various approaches he adopted to tackle it, especially in the later part
   (1970-2003) of his long assiduous academic life (1913-2006).

AB The treatise mainly deals with the Polish philosopher Brzozowski's
   thought. It sketches his life and writings and discusses his relations
   to Orthodox Marxism. The recent research reveals him as inclined to
   Western Marxism. However, unlike other thinkers of Western Marxism such
   as Lukacs and Gramsci his intellectual position was controversial and
   not unquestionably accepted by the Western world. The reason may be
   found in his overwhelming devotion to the study of Polish arts,
   literature and nationhood. Polish nationalism was more close to his
   heart than Marxism. Thus, he was stripped of the name of a Marxist by
   official Marxism which condemned and treated him as a deviator and
   betrayer due to his idea blended with classical German Idealism. The
   above-mentioned controversy may be clarified through revisit of his
   theory of history and practice. This article aims at illuminations and
   evaluations by Brzozowski's contribution to Marxism.

AB This review essay attempts to understand the book under review against
   the background of Jameson's previous writings. Failing to do so would
   invite misunderstanding since there are few contemporary theorists whose
   writing forms so much of a unity. Jameson's book can be divided into
   three parts. The first and most important part deals with dialectics,
   the second with politics, and the third with philosophy of history. In
   the first part Jameson argues that dialectics best captures our
   relationship to the sociocultural and historical world we are living in.
   The second part makes clear that Jameson is not prepared to water down
   his own Marxist politics in order to spare the liberal sensibilities of
   his political opponents. In the third part Jameson develops his own
   philosophy of history, mainly in a dialogue with Ricoeur. Dialectics is
   his main weapon in his discussion with Ricoeur, and it becomes clear
   that the Spinozism of dialectics allows for a better understanding of
   history and of historical writing than does Ricoeur's phenomenological
   approach. The book is an impressive testimony to the powers of
   dialectical thought and to its indispensability for a proper grasp of
   historical writing.

   economic strategy. The paper advances economic strategy of broadening
   sources of income and reducing expenditure in order to guarantee the
   funds needed for constructing the system. Finally, the paper calls on

AB This article tries to perceive how secularization spreads in a legal
   state and in the European Union. The author states that when a legal
   state begins to violate the life issues, the state ceases to form a
   democratically healthy society. Secularization is a process in which a
   person tries to "escape" from religious influence in the society and to
   leave religion in "a private corner". The author proves that the supreme
   escape from the influence of God used to be in the philosophy of
   Nietzsche, when God was "killed." This philosophy was espoused by
   Hitler, and Europe was" liberated in the best way" from Christian
   influence by deaths of millions. By immense historical indicators the
   author proves how both atheistic ideologies of Nazism and
   Marxist-Leninism cooperated until the very beginning of the Second World
   War. In one word, secularization has no limits. Secularization can
   become very dangerous in certain circumstances. The rejection of belief
   in a society inclines towards a denial of God. The laws of European
   Union concerning the family, birth and religion already abuse the right
   of birth. The article tries to show the point of view of the Holy See in
   the future of the European Union and the theologian's mission in a
   globalized world.

AB Mark Fisher's Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative? is a
   provocative polemical analysis of the narrowing of political horizons
   that has occurred over the past couple of decades and of the powerful
   ideological grip that capitalism holds on the collective, social psyche,
   destroying our capacity to imagine political alternatives. Fisher seeks
   to illuminate the major cultural and social efffects of a post-Cold War
   politico-ideological condition in which (according to Zizek's well-known
   observation) 'it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to
   imagine the end of capitalism'. Building on this analysis, Fisher
   identif.ies some key tensions and contradictions in the ideological
   armour of contemporary capitalism and extrapolates from this some
   tentative strategic propositions for the anticapitalist Left. This
   review-article argues that, while Fisher's book provides valuable
   conceptual and strategic resources for the Left, it is hamstrung by
   several weaknesses - not the least of these a tendency to make
   unconvincing, sweeping claims about the novelty and distinctness of what
   Fisher terms 'capitalist realism' and a tendency to present a caricature
   of current left-wing thinking.

AB Adam Schaff (b. March 10, 1913, Lwow - d November 12, 2006 Warsaw,) was
   a Polish Marxist philosopher with a special interest in philosophy of
   language and semiotics, in theory of knowledge and political economy. He
   focused on problems of semantics, theory of ideology the relation
   between language and reality, formal logic, and dialectics. But he also
   showed a great interest in ethics dealing with the problem of the human
   individual and the relation between humanism and Marxism. Concerning
   this aspect he evidenced the connection between the interpretation of
   Marxism and translation of Marxian terminology, showing the influence of
   ideology in the practice of translation. As a polish philosopher, Schaff
   oriented his analysis in a semiotic sense, examining in particular the
   symptomatology of today's social politics. During the 1980s. he promoted
   a series of meetings in different countries throughout Eastern and
   Western Europe to analyze and compare the different versions in
   different languages of the Helsinki Final Act of 1975 from a semiotic
   perspective. Certain of the topical relevance of his work in semiotics,
   in this paper we examine a series of issues at the center of Schaff's
   attention such as the conception of the human individual, the relation
   between language and knowledge, language and dialectics, the influence
   of ideology in translation, linguistic fetishism and stereotypes,
   critique of Chomskyian theory of language, and of hypostatization of
   such concepts as "structure" and "structuralism."

AB An English text of Carl Schmitt's Hamlet or Hecuba makes it vital to
   question the turn from French theory to Germany philosophy in
   Shakespeare studies, given a Left flirtation with Schmitt's Political
   Theology begun by Walter Benjamin. The Marxist critic's fascination with
   fascism was decried by Terry Eagleton as a theoretical error. So it is
   ironic that Eagleton's William Shakespeare was driven by the same
   Schmittian idea that "sovereign is he who decides the exception'' in
   language or law. Eagleton backtracked on its cult of violence after
   9/11. But 25 years on, his introduction to the plays shows the danger of
   using Shakespeare to decide necessary violence, not least in its own
   exceptional force of argument. This article thus considers Eagleton's
   book to be an early example of the coincidence of opposites that
   currently attracts Shakespeareans to dubious existentialist notions of
   decision and risk.

   Plato's political ideas among Polish scholars depended on political
   situation of Poland and Europe. Selected works of three periods are
   under examination. Before the World War I the enthusiasm towards Plato's
   political ideas prevailed. In the interwar period the enthusiasm waned
   and the utopian project of the Republic was considered as impossible to
   be carried out. After the World War II Plato's project was negatively
   evaluated by the opponents of the totalitarianism and communism as well
   as by the Marxist philosophers. The former considered communism to be a
   fulfillment of Plato's ideas, the latter thought of Plato as an enemy of
   the democratic system.

AB In their article "About the Human Condition in the Works of Dickens and
   Marx" Ami E. Stearns and Thomas J. Burns contribute to the study of
   Charles Dickens's Industrial Revolution-era fiction by examining his
   novels in relation to Karl Marx's social philosophy. Stearns and Burns
   postulate that Dickens relies on Marxist concepts of class
   consciousness, sacrifice, revolution, social antitheses, and social
   injustice to weave his narratives and compare and discuss six of
   Dickens' novels: A Tale of Two Cities, A Christmas Carol, David
   Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and Great Expectations with three works of
   Marx: Grundrisse, The Communist Manifesto, and Capital. Their analysis
   suggests that the fictionalized world of Dickens parallels the
   fundamental social theses in Marx's writings. Further, their study
   reveals that the narratives of Dickens present Marx's concepts as
   relevant and accessible within popular imagination.

AB This paper argues that Elias's work presupposes a radical abandonment of
   philosophy as a vestige of magical-mythical thinking that has been
   rendered obsolete by the rise of sociology. For Elias, attempts by
   philosophers to claim a continuing non-empirical area of investigation
   are spurious and reflect only professional interests. The origins of
   Elias's position are traced to his rejection of neo-Kantianism and his
   participation in the Wissenssoziologie of Karl Mannheim in Weimar
   Germany. Focusing on the traditional ethical or normative questions, the
   paper shows how Elias's conception of the 'detour via detachment'
   enabled him to transcribe these issues (as well as traditional
   epistemological and ontological questions) into sociologically
   manageable terms. His strategy is further clarified through a comparison
   with the all-pervasive Critical Sociology approach to these matters,
   which emerges as severely handicapped by its reliance upon
   quasi-metaphysical, transcendental arguments. Also, its attributions of
   social blame generate fear images that reinforce conflict and its
   negative over-statements strengthen anxiety and frustration, thereby
   bolstering precisely what it is trying to change. The paper reveals the
   tacit function as a leftist code-word that the term 'critical' performs
   for many sociologists. Neo-Marxist 'critique' is shown to be a
   profoundly flawed attempt to deal with issues of theory and practice.

   little effects of Lysenkoism upon botanists and their research, as well
   as how botanists for the most part rejected what was often termed the
   "new biology." My paper shows that though Lysenko's theories received
   political support, and were actively promoted by a small circle of
   scientists and Communist party activists, they were never accepted by
   most botanists. Once the political climate in Poland altered after the
   events of 1956, Lysenko's theories were immediately abandoned.

AB In recent years, there are many significant exchanges among scholars of
   cultural studies or cultural theory and scholars of Christian Studies.
   Some cultural theorists, e.g. Alain Badiou, attempted to explore and
   evaluate the political implications of Christian theology, especially
   that of St. Paul. Apart from a few with strong religious background,
   e.g. Michel de Certeau, many of the cultural theorists are not
   Christians in term of religious affiliation. However, they actively
   engaged in critical dialogue with Christian theologians. The debate
   between Slavoj Zizek and John Milbank is one of the notable examples.
   Some Christian theologians, including Kathryn Tanner, Graham Ward and
   Kwok Pui-lan, make use of some cultural theories to analyze Christian
   theology.
   There are some apparent similarities between these cultural theorists
   and the proponents of Sino-theology. Many of the latter are neither
   professional theologians nor active members of Christian churches, but
   very familiar with Marxist philosophy and well aware of the political
   issues related to culture. They discuss theological ideas primarily from
   cultural perspectives and engage in dialogue with church theologians as
   well as non-religious intellectuals in China.
   The interactions between cultural theory and Christian Studies in the
   Western academia are relevant to Sino-theology in several ways. Firstly,
   the happening of this interplay in the Western academia confirms the
   legitimacy of the endeavour of Sino-theology in promoting theological
   discussion in the academia rather the Christian churches. Secondly, the
   contemporary understanding of culture, with its emphasis on the facture
   and struggle of ordinary culture rather than the unity of high culture,
   supports the agenda of Sino-theology to break with indigenous theology,
   which tends to accommodation Christian theology to the traditional
   Chinese culture, and to focus on the theological task related to the
   dynamic and pluralistic culture of contemporary China, including the
   critique of national ideology. Thirdly, the Marxist background of these
   cultural theories may facilitate and enhance the dialogue between the
   proponents of Sino-theology and other intellectuals in contemporary
   China.
   In short, the interactions among cultural theory and Christian Studies
   in the Western academia may inspire the discussion concerning
   Sino-theology and deserve to be studied thoroughly in the context of
   contemporary China.

   articles, published in the 1990s, Solov'ev has attempted to apply the
   ideas of Kant's social philosophy to post-Soviet realities. Kant is
   important above all as a theoretician of a free subjectivity, human
   rights, and a critic of paternalism in social life. Several Kantian
   motives came to the fore during the perestrojka when the Marxist "class
   approach" was abandoned and "all-human" values (obsceceloveceskie
   tsennosti) entered into the discussion. Later, Solov'ev attempted to
   develop Kantian guidelines for a post-Soviet society, including moral
   norms for businessmen in the new Russia, but these attempts bore the
   distinct hallmark of social utopianism.

AB This paper discusses the theory of socialism endorsed by Li Dazhao,
   China's first Marxist, as an effort to integrate western ideas into the
   traditional Chinese thinking during the chaotic years of the 1920s.
   There are two aspects of Li's theory of socialism which, while related,
   are distinct: (1) a theory about the nature of socialist society, and
   (2) a theory about how a socialist society can be achieved in China.
   Li's development of (1) is influenced by his acceptance of the classical
   Confucian notion of the Great Harmony while his account of (2) draws
   upon both his acceptance of the Daoist account of historical change and
   on classic Confucianism. Understanding his theory of socialism thus
   requires locating it within these two doctrines of classical Chinese
   philosophy.

   debates, and only drawing from that tradition it is possible to
   understand Manuel Sacristan's proposal to put an end to the faculties of
   philosophy in 1968; to this suggestion Gustavo Bueno responded. The
   reconstruction of this debate allows to salvage a reflection on the
   philosophy of Ortega which enables original responses to the problem of
   the autonomy of philosophy and its relationship to other forms of
   knowledge. This reflection was critically updated restructured during
   the debate between both authors, though until now has gone relatively

AB In one of his last writings, Life: Experience and Science, Michel
   Foucault argued that twentieth-century French philosophy could be read
   as dividing itself into two divergent lines: on the one hand, we have a
   philosophical stream which takes individual experience as its point of
   departure, conceiving it as irreducible to science. On the other hand,
   we have an analysis of knowledge which takes into account the concrete
   productions of the mind, as are found in science and human practices. In
   order to account for this division, Foucault opposed epistemologists
   such as Cavaille's and Canguilhem to phenomenologists such as
   Merleau-Ponty and Sartre but, also, and more particularly, he opposed
   Poincare to Bergson. The latter was presented by Foucault as being the
   key-figure of the "philosophy of experience" at the beginning of the
   twentieth century. Fifteen years later, in his Deleuze and in the Logics
   of Worlds, Alain Badiou again uses this dual structure in his
   interpretation of the past hundred years of French thought. He employs a
   series of oppositional couples: himself and Deleuze, Lautmann and
   Sartre, and, finally, Brunschvicg and Bergson. On the one hand a
   "mathematical Platonism" and on the other a "philosophy of vital
   interiority.'' This Manichean reading of philosophy, and the strategic
   use of the figure of Bergson has, itself, a long tradition. It was also
   proposed by Althusser who, following Bachelard, opposed his standpoint
   to any form of "empiricism." Althusser developed his thought from a
   tradition of Marxist thinkers and ideologists, which included Politzer's
   and Nizan's critique of bourgeois philosophy and, even before that,
   neo-Kantians such as the philosophers of the Revue de metaphysique et de
   morale. The aim of this essay is to deconstruct and to put into its
   precise context of production this series of genealogies which entails
   the mobilization of Bergsonism and of the name 'Bergson.' By doing so, I
   hope to weight the importance of Bergsonism in twentieth-century French
   philosophy, in both its "positive" and its "negative" aspect. The essay
   will proceed regressively, taking into account figures such as
   Althusser, Badiou, Deleuze, Foucault, Canguilhem, Cavaille's, Sartre,
   Merleau-Ponty, but also Polizer, Brunschvicg and Alain. The conclusion
   of the essay is an attempt at reading the "Bergson renaissance" in the
   light of new discoveries in genetics and the cognitive sciences and to
   tie it to the renewal of studies in the history of French philosophy.

AB The article attempts to revive the conception of the body in Ludwig
   Feuerbach and the young Marx. The aim is to show that Feuerbach produced
   a concept of embodiment which is to be distinguished from its conception
   in psychoanalysis and in political thought (the body as the object of
   bio-power) which prevail in contemporary post-Marxist theory. The
   difference between these two conceptions can be expressed thus: the
   Feuerbachian and young-Marxian understanding corresponds to the concept
   sarx (the natural body), while its conception in post-Marxist thought
   corresponds to the concept soma (the body symbolised).
   Post-Marxist authors generally assume the correctness of Althusser's
   rejection of this conception. It is for this reason that I examine
   Althusser's critique of Feuerbach's philosophy in its relation to the
   question of embodiment and I attempt to show that Althusser's theory
   cannot comprehend Feuerbach's most important discovery.
   In the final part I deal with Feuerbach as the first thinker of
   non-identity (Adorno's term) and I look at his reflections on death as
   the hidden background of his "living and real body". The conclusion is
   that Feuerbach introduces a conception of embodiment which cannot be
   completely incorporated into cultural and bio-political practices.

AB This review-essay explores the subterranean tradition of 'creative
   Soviet Marxism'(1) through a recent book by the Russian philosopher
   Sergey Mareev, From the History of Soviet Philosophy: Lukacs - Vygotsky
   - Ilyenkov (2008). It provides a brief overview of the history of Soviet
   philosophy so as to orient the reader to a set of debates that continue
   to be largely unexplored in the Western-Marxist tradition. Mareev offers
   a new account of the development of Soviet philosophy that not only
   explodes the myth that Soviet philosophy was simply state-sanctioned
   dogma, but also reinterprets the relationship between the key creative
   theorists so as to offer a new way of understanding its development that
   challenges several key-aspects of the dominant Western scholarship on
   this subject. He argues that alongside official Marxist philosophy in
   the Soviet Union - the crude materialism of Diamat and Istmat - there
   existed another line, which counterposed the central role of social
   activity in the development of human consciousness. He traces this line
   of anti-positivist theory from V. I. Lenin through Georg Lukacs and Lev
   Vygotsky to Evald Ilyenkov - a pivotal figure in the 'Marxian
   renaissance'(2) of the 1960s, but who 'has to this day remained a Soviet
   phenomenon without much international influence'.(3) Specifically,
   Mareev disputes the role of A. M. Deborin as a precursor of the Ilyenkov
   school, and instead introduces Georg Lukacs - a figure primarily
   recognised in the West as one of the founders of Western Marxism - into
   the line of development of creative Soviet Marxism. Furthermore, he
   reconsiders the role of V. I. Lenin and G. V. Plekhanov - the so-called
   father of Russian social democracy - in the development of Soviet
   philosophy. In the process, the author provides a detailed history of
   the emergence of Diamat and Istmat, and shines a spotlight on a figure
   widely recognised as the most important Soviet philosopher in the
   post-Stalin period - E. V. Ilyenkov.

   the text will provide even knowledgeable Marxist readers with new
   insights on key texts and concepts in Marx, it nevertheless fails to
   intervene in crucial contemporary philosophical debates. The book is
   concerned less with the contemporary significance of Marxist philosophy
   as philosophy and more with re-reading classical Marxist texts in a
   contemporary context. This job it does well, but leaves the more
   important question of what Marxists have to say about fundamental
   philosophical problems today unaddressed for the most part.

AB This article tries to perceive how secularization spreads in a legal
   state and in the European Union. The author states that when a legal
   state begins to violate the life issues, the state ceases to form a
   democratically healthy society. Secularization is a process in which a
   person tries to "escape" from religious influence in the society and to
   leave religion in "a private corner". The author proves that the supreme
   escape from the influence of God used to be in the philosophy of
   Nietzsche, when God was "killed." This philosophy was espoused by
   Hitler, and Europe was" liberated in the best way" from Christian
   influence by deaths of millions. By immense historical indicators the
   author proves how both atheistic ideologies of Nazism and
   Marxist-Leninism cooperated until the very beginning of the Second World
   War. In one word, secularization has no limits. Secularization can
   become very dangerous in certain circumstances. The rejection of belief
   in a society inclines towards a denial of God. The laws of European
   Union concerning the family, birth and religion already abuse the right
   of birth. The article tries to show the point of view of the Holy See in
   the future of the European Union and the theologian's mission in a
   globalized world.

   Vallejo, with the object of determining the fundamental isotopies which
   articulate the vision of the world expressed in these poems. From the
   isotopy we have named "tragic conscience", the poetic text generates
   three new thematic isotopies (God, childhood, woman) which appear as a
   response to the absurd perception of life. For this analysis we use
   contextual references taken from the author's biography and the historic
   period in which Vallejo lived, particularly the references of
   Existential philosophy and Marxist philosophy. We also base this
   analysis on the notions of man-Adam and man-Christ as expressions of the

AB Mikhail Lific (1905-1983) is one of the most contradictory and to this
   date poorly understood authors of the Soviet era. He represented an
   independent Marxist position, but one internally characterized by the
   tense relationship between Marxism and the philosophy of Hegel. This
   relationship, concerning historical philosophical questions, is the
   subject of this essay. In the 1930s, as "historical materialism" was
   canonized in the USSR, a development that Soviet civilization understood
   as the "beginning of the end of (universal) history", Lific drafted a
   different, skeptical summary of the revolutionary era. However, he
   remained loyal to both the concept of universal history and the
   examination of Russian-Soviet cultural history within the framework of
   this concept. With the help of a text from Lific from the 1930s as well
   as his later (early 1980s) reflection and remembrance of the ideological
   debates of the 1930s, this essay will show that Lific' reconstruction of
   idealism in Marxism was no accident, but rather a necessary movement in
   thought. This, in turn, enabled him to give a new account of the
   historical experience of the October Revolution.

AB The present text tries to present this reflexive critical approach to
   the ideas of Marx that Sanchez Vazquez creates starting from an
   interpretation of the Theses on Feuerbach and especially the relation
   between praxis and knowledge, included in exemplary way within this
   analysis. The concept of praxis, as it introduces Sanchez Vazquez in
   Latin America, overcomes then the generalized dominant idea that the
   theory must guide the action, when making understandable that praxis
   means the double presence of theory and action in the same moment and in
   the same person. This concept, of central importance for Marx, but
   forgotten by many Marxists in the first half of century twenty, achieves
   to establish the necessary theoretical bases for to surpass the ideology
   and reality of a leader or central committee who's are predestined to
   guide the blind masses without falling in a false indifference according
   to which every one has its own truth. That would be, in the final
   analysis, an apparently open and tolerant truth, but without any cutting
   edge for to face seriously the over helming and nearly omnipresent
   falsenesses about the apparently actuality of the capitalist form of

AB The world of Chinese philosophy witnessed an ideological storm that
   raged for almost four decades in the second half of the twentieth
   century, and Ren Jiyu (1916-2009) was a leading figure in it. The
   Marxist interpretation of traditional Chinese thought in terms of five
   scientifically determined historical stages, an economic substructure
   with its ideological superstructure, and a continuous struggle between
   materialism and idealism, was like a whirlwind that came and went in
   Chinese academia. This interpretive framework for the study of Chinese
   philosophy dominated the field between the 1950s and the 1980s, when it
   was rapidly marginalized. Now that the winds have subsided and the
   Marxist straitjacket has become much looser, scholars of Chinese thought
   and historians interested in the twentieth century have something to
   reflect upon: the nature, the impact, and the value of Marxist
   intellectuals. How were differences of opinion expressed and treated
   within the boundaries of what was ideologically acceptable? How did
   views emerge, evolve, and loosen within this period? This selection of
   six influential articles written by Ren Jiyu give an insight into these
   questions coining from one particular voice.

AB The present paper offers a narrative of the post-World War II
   development of Hungarian philosophy, and argues that it is characterized
   by a double, historical and anthropological orientation under Marx's
   influence. The resulting amalgam is an intellectual history that looks
   beyond the ideas themselves, searching for underlying images of man
   which are represented as ideological backgrounds to theories of nature,
   society, cognition, etc. The most important works of this approach
   interpret ideas and anthropologies within a Marxist framework, and see
   them as closely linked to the social-historical circumstances in which
   they develop; yet, these approaches represent an alternative attitude
   quite different from the official ideology of dialectical materialism.

AB Whereas Phenomenology of Perception concludes with a puzzling turn to
   "heroism," this article examines the short essay "Man, the Hero" as a
   source of insight into Merleau-Ponty's thought in the early postwar
   period. In this essay, Merleau-Ponty presented a conception of heroism
   through which he expressed the attitude toward post-Hegelian philosophy
   of history that underwrote his efforts to reform Marxism along
   existential lines. Analyzing this conception of heroism by unpacking the
   implicit contrasts with KojSve, Aron, Caillois, and Bataille, I show
   that its philosophical rationale was to supply experiential evidence
   attesting to the latent presence of human universality. It is a mythic
   device intended to animate the faith necessary for Marxist politics by
   showing that universal sociality is possible, and that the historically
   transformative praxis needed to realize it does not imply sacrifice.
   This sheds considerable light on Merleau-Ponty's early postwar political
   thought. But inasmuch as the latter cannot be severed from his broader
   philosophical concerns, the prospect is raised that his entire
   phenomenological project in the early postwar period rested on a myth.
   Not necessarily a bad myth, but a myth nonetheless.

AB The central perspectives and concepts of the aesthetics and politics of
   the philosophy of Jean-Francoise Lyotard are presented in this text. The
   emergence from the war leads Lyotard, starting with his first texts in
   1948, to question politics, ask for a critical philosophy
   (Phenomenology, 1954), and a later distance himself from philosophy
   during the years in which he became a militant with the Marxist group
   which published the magazine Socialism or Barbarism, with which he
   remains until 1966. Why Philosophyze (1964) captures the aforementioned
   experience and defines the orientation and research themes of later
   investigations of critical philosophy from which aesthetics, politics,
   and the concepts that relate these two areas are given thought. A first
   critical perspective of aesthetics focuses on the relationship between
   desire and arts, and between desire and the critical discourse, starting
   with Discourse, figure (1971) and ending with Libidinal Economy (1974).
   This study ends with a Nietzsche-like aesthetic and politic described as
   paths adrift with the strongest of libidinal intensities. The evaluation
   of these practices in libidinal economy and the devices of capitalism,
   in particular, lead Lyotard to change his perspective. From pragmatic
   analyses of the games of language in discourses, knowledge and tales, as
   well as the practices and institutions of advanced societies, The
   Postmodern Condition (1982-1985) integrates the aesthetic manner of
   reflexive judgement (Kant) to the proposal of a postmodern "critical
   knowledge". The Enthusiasm (1986) proposes a analogy of aesthetic and
   critical judgment applied to the political. Due to the multiplication of
   languages and their heterogeneity, unsolvable conflicts arise which are
   analyzed by Lyotard, mostly under the concept of diferend (The
   Difference, 1983), the sublime in The Postmodern Explained to Children,
   and The Inhuman. In covering these issues, this text defines steps and
   analogous elements between critique, aesthetics, and politics.

AB The development in Europe and domestic theological school in Spisska
   Kapitula before 1949 had given an impulse to theological pluralism. The
   marxist ideology ironically had helped the process which stimulated
   theological thinking in the twentieth century based on practical-social
   analysis and attempting to interpret historical events. The spirit of
   openness of John XXIII. inspired Jozef Uhrin to work, using Pope's
   method in a way that a historian does not use historicism as normative
   for his work. Instead he is making historicism in his historical
   approach to religious and societal questions. His active commitment to
   the theology field and Church's historiography showed a way to Christian
   message inculturation under conditions of socialist social order. In a
   sharp contrast to his interpretative study stands the effort of Jan
   Chryzostom Korec. In his work until 1989 Korec discharges
   practical-social theological movement of marxist analysis and in all
   human solidarity gives priority to historical interpretation that
   assists a fight for justice in the socialist Czechoslovakia.
   Social movements in 1968 has made it possible for newly accepted
   professors of Theology faculty in Bratislava a comeback to
   interpretation models which rely on neo-scholasticism in philosophy and
   theology A way in this metaphysics-hermeneutical line has showed
   attractive to the work of historians from younger generations, Viliam
   Judaic and Jozef Halo. They established social search of the Church as a
   stable institution when writing history or they put her forward as a
   visible sacramental sign.
   Among Slovaks in foreign countries springs out an original look at life
   from existential level. Felix Litva has attempted to look at historical
   events of Slovak Canadian and American believers from years of
   1952-1999.
   Final question in this article is about whether it is possible
   positively interpret theologically reasoned mission of Ostpolitik by
   cardinal Agostino Casaroli in Czechoslovakia (1963-1989) and for what
   Church's model. It is not excluded that a historian will do an excellent
   work after he can answer the question of profiles in historiographical
   efforts.

AB The idea of cultural citizenship is often associated with a present-day
   context of multiculturalism, and seen as a novel issue for political
   philosophy. Within political philosophy it has been mainly
   conceptualised within a liberal tradition focusing on (cultural) rights.
   The concept also features in cultural studies, to articulate the
   importance of artistic and media practices to citizenship. This article
   aims to orient the debate to wider theoretical concerns, and to a
   long-standing political-philosophical interest in the relation of
   politics and culture. It proposes a 'broad view' of cultural
   citizenship, which moreover locates cultural citizenship in concerns
   about the public sphere. It revisits historical philosophical positions
   on the relation of politics and culture, viz those of Karl Marx and John
   Stuart Mill. The distinct conceptual models ensuing from their work both
   expound 'broad views', which take the relation between politics and
   culture to impact on all citizens. The article subsequently discusses a
   recent Dutch policy report on cultural citizenship, which shows that
   these models still have topical relevance. Next, a fourfold grid is
   elaborated of weak and strong, positive and negative views on how
   citizenship is to be related to issues of culture. The article concludes
   by arguing for a neorepublican approach of cultural citizenship that
   adopts a 'weak positive' view and may repair the conceptual drawbacks of
   both the liberal and Marxist views.

   philosophy. Zaksas is a priori convinced that his own theory is
   impeccable and that the subject of inquiry is undoubtedly fallacious and
   theoretically worthless. Balcius and Griska pay more attention to the
   description of the subject of inquiry. They rely on the materialistic,
   atheistic and scientist aspects of Marxism. Lozuraitis and Mureika
   regard Marxism as quite a reliable method of solving some theoretical
   problems. Their approach is akin to the methodology of the history of
   problems.

AB The paper presents an overview of analytical philosophy in Lithuania. It
   is observed that analytical philosophy had not been studied or developed
   in Lithuania before the 1970s, when Evaldas Nekrasas and Rolandas
   Pavilionis began their work in philosophy of science and philosophy of
   language, rooted in analytical tradition. The article discusses the
   works of Nekrasas and Pavilionis, as well as those of others (e.g.,
   Degutis and Plesnys). It notes that analytical philosophy was the first
   non-Marxist trend of philosophy to be developed in post-war Lithuania,
   and thus it was of considerable influence at the time when the Marxist
   methodology had to be overthrown. Although the influence of analytical
   philosophy in Lithuania has diminished during later years in favour of
   postmodern trends, it is still evident in some recent works on
   philosophy of mind, philosophy of causation, and methodology of the
   humanities and social sciences. It has also made a strong impact upon
   the development of political philosophy and research in the history of
   positivism.

AB This review article situates the work Black Flame within a capita
   selecta of earlier publications on anarchism-syndicalism and radical
   thought. Schmidt and Van der Walt's contribution (2009) is a recent
   addition to political thought, theory and socio-economic practice within
   the broad stream of anarcho-syndicalism. Its treatment of anarchism and
   anarchist syndicalist groups in the workplace within an international
   context since the middle 1800s and the attempt to situate the debate in
   contemporary society are some notable features. The authors engage with
   the past relevance of anarcho-syndicalism and implications for the
   future given current discontent with (global) politics. As an ongoing
   discourse on social philosophy, references are made to areas of
   agreement and differences between Anarchist and Marxist discourse. The
   latter versus one 'grand narrative' conjectures that liberal-capitalism
   on a global scale is bringing about an 'End of History' and that we have
   entered a post-industrial or even post-modern condition on the globe.
   However, theories-put-into-practice around the implosion of history and
   a 'clash of civilisations' result in deep inequality and the rise of
   absolute poverty. The work invites reflection and critical engagement.

AB The development of radical Islamist strategic thinking and the impact of
   post-modern, Western styles of thought upon the ideology that informs
   that strategy is often overlooked in conventional discussions of
   homegrown threats from jihadist militants. The propensity to discount
   the ideology informing both al-Qaeda and nominally non-violent Islamist
   movements with an analogous political philosophy like Hizb ut-Tahrir
   neglects the influence that critical Western modes of thought exercise
   upon their strategic thinking especially in the context of homegrown
   radicalization. Drawing selectively on non-liberal tendencies in the
   Western ideological canon has, in fact, endowed Khilaafaism (caliphism)
   with both a distinctive theoretical style and strategic practice. In
   particular, it derives intellectual sustenance from a post-Marxist
   Frankfurt School of critical thinking that in combination with an
   "English'' School of international relations idealism holds that
   epistemological claims are socially determined, subjective, and serve
   the interests of dominant power relations. This critical, normative, and
   constructivist approach to international relations seeks not only to
   explain the historical emergence of the global order, but also to
   transcend it. This transformative agenda bears comparison with radical
   Islamist critiques of Western ontology and is of interest to Islamism's
   political and strategic thinking. In this regard, the relativist and
   critical approaches that have come to dominate the academic social
   sciences since the 1990s not only reflect a loss of faith in Western
   values in a way that undermines the prospects for a liberal and
   pluralist polity, but also, through a critical process facilitated by
   much international relations orthodoxy, promotes the strategic and
   ideological agenda of radical Islam. It is this curious strategic and
   ideological evolution that this paper explores.

AB The specific nuances of what Gramsci names 'the new dialectic' are
   explored in this paper. The dialectic was Marx's specific 'mode of
   thought' or 'method of logic' as it has been variously called, by which
   he analyzed the world and man's relationship to that world. As well as
   constituting a theory of knowledge (epistemology), what arises out of
   the dialectic is also an ontology or portrait of humankind that is based
   on the complete historicization of humanity; its 'absolute
   "historicism"' or 'the absolute secularisation and earthliness of
   thought', as Gramsci worded it (Gramsci, 1971, p. 465). Embracing a
   fully secular and historical view of humanity, it provides a vantage
   point that allows the multiple and complex effects of our own conceptual
   heritage to be interrogated in relation to our developing 'nature' or
   'being'.
   The argument presented in this paper is that the legacy of both Hegel
   and Marx is manifest in the depth of Gramsci's comprehension of what he
   termed the 'educative-formative' problem of hegemony. It is precisely
   the legacy of this Hegelian-Marxist radical philosophical critique that
   is signified in his continuing commitment to the 'philosophy of praxis'
   and the historical-dialectical principles that underpin this worldview.

AB John Roemer once described the 'intellectual foundations' of analytical
   Marxism as the recognition that, despite having a valid core, Marxism
   rested upon outdated social science. The solution, he believed, was to
   update the theory 'using state-of-the-art methods of analytical
   philosophy and "positivist" social science'. If one takes this
   definition literally, Jurgen Habermas' early work qualifies as that of
   an analytical Marxist. Yet although he developed his project in a way
   that was independent of the self-identified analytical Marxists, there
   are important points of convergence in their views. In particular, in
   their efforts to update Marxism, both Habermas and the analytical
   Marxists managed to talk themselves out of being Marxists in any
   recognizable sense of the term. This is a noteworthy outcome, given the
   differences in their points of departure. This article tracks the
   intellectual history of these two movements, in order to identify the
   tendencies that pushed this rather disparate group of theorists in the
   same direction.

AB Since the late 1960s Quentin Skinner has defended a highly influential
   form of linguistic contextualism for the history of ideas, originally
   devised in opposition to established methodological orthodoxies like the
   'great text' tradition and a mainly Marxist epiphenomenalism. In 2002,
   he published Regarding Method, a collection of his revised
   methodological essays that provides a uniquely systematic expression of
   his contextualist philosophy of history. Skinner's most arresting
   theoretical contention in that work remains his well-known claim that
   past works of political theory cannot be read as contributions to
   'perennial' debates but must instead be understood as particularistic,
   ideological speech acts. In this article I argue that he fails to
   justify these claims and that there is actually nothing wrong at all
   with (where appropriate) treating past works of political theory as
   engaged in perennial philosophical debates. Not only do Skinner's
   arguments not support the form of contextualism he defends, their flaws
   are actually akin to those he identified in his critique of previous
   methodological orthodoxies.

AB Two major developments of the last two decades have radically undermined
   traditional justifications of leftist politics: the failure of
   20th-century 'socialist' experiments, and what might be termed the
   de-essentializing movement in contemporary philosophy. However, the
   social injustices that animated revolutionary thinkers in many respects
   remain, and some have arguably worsened in the era of globalized
   capitalism. This article investigates whether it is possible to
   articulate a new theoretical underpinning for progressive politics that
   nevertheless avoids the essentialist moves of Marxism. Ethico-political
   readings of Derrida - one of the most influential anti-essentialist
   thinkers - are compared to Ernesto Laclau's attempts at formulating a
   post-Marxist progressive politics built around the notions of 'hegemony'
   and 'radical democracy'. Laclau's intervention in the Marxist tradition
   is to deconstruct its traditional categories so as to take account of
   contingency; his intervention in deconstruction is to introduce what in
   this article is described as 'contestation', so as to provide a more
   coherent account of the political. The article concludes that neither
   deconstruction nor radical democracy provides an adequate basis for
   poltical action, but that the latter's account of the political is a
   meaningful development of the theoretical schema articulated by the
   former and does point to the possibility of a non-essentialist
   progressive politics.

AB In an interview after his release from prison, Breyten Breytenbach
   describes himself, at the time he became involved in underground
   politics, as a Zen Communist. He returns occasionally to this
   interaction of Marxist ideas of social revolution and Buddhist ideas of
   non-attachment, but never attempts to explain the resulting synthesis
   systematically. Indeed, for Breytenbach, being a Zen Communist is to
   resist systematic positions, to accept contradiction as a constant
   source of surprise and invention disruptive of all systematic thought.
   This paper examines how this interaction of Marxist and Buddhist ideas
   and practices has informed Breytenbach's politics in three contexts: his
   initial exploration of a radical philosophy of history in his poetry
   ("Bruin reisbrief", "Brown travel letter"); his role in the underground
   politics of Okhelo in the 1970s, his reflections on politics and social
   change in his prison and prison-related writings.

   He uses it in two different ways: either generally as contrasted with
   theory, or as a specifically defined term within his
   Neo-Aristotelianism. These two meanings are independent from each other.
   The paper is a reconstruction of MacIntyre's argument concerning the
   notion of practice in its general sense and as related to the concept of
   theory. First, it analyses practice as opposed to theory, and its
   Marxist roots; second, it outlines the post-Marxist revolutionary
   "Benedictine" vision of MacIntyre's Thomistic Aristotelianism, third,
   the issue in question is exemplified via the mutual relationship between
   political philosophy and politics; finally, several implications of the
   author's argument are suggested. The paper claims that those engaged in
   elaboration, critique and implementation of political and/or moral
   theories may benefit from MacIntyre's insightful account of the
   significance of practice for theory.

AB The German Turner movement, a nationalistic gymnastic enterprise,
   migrated to the United States in the aftermath of the failed revolution
   of 1848. It quickly took hold in American cities with sizable German
   populations. Many German Turners espoused liberal philosophies,
   including Marxist, socialist and anarchist sympathies in their political
   views. They assumed leadership roles in politics, education and the
   labour movement; but those radical sympathies dissipated over time in
   the United States. This case study of Chicago, the centre of the
   American labour movement and a bastion of Turnerism in the United
   States, examines and analyzes the transition of Turner ideology and
   practice, from initial radicalism to incorporation within the mainstream
   political system, and from a focus on gymnastics to adoption of American
   sport forms. That transition occurred rather rapidly, largely over a
   period of two generations, by which time American Turners admitted that
   they had little in common with their European brethren. The article
   offers insights into the complex nature of sport, ideology and practice
   within the process of cultural flow.

   Popper's influence has been quite often if not mediated then at least
   supported by other developments within German philosophy. Not
   surprisingly, from the very beginning Popper's philosophical return ran
   up against the prevalent local philosophical tendencies of the times,
   from a selective but mostly negative Marxist attitude to a patent
   disinterest and disregard by most existentialists, phenomenologists, and
   Heideggerians. A rather important role in this complex situation has
   been played by Hans Albert; from the late 1950s on he has been an
   outspoken protagonist for Popper's philosophy. The scope of Albert's
   activities extends from expository endeavors to critical exchanges with
   the opponents; of the latter the best known being his early involvement
   in the so-called "Positivismusstreit", covering a substantial part of
   the 1970s. However, Albert's role was never one of a mere apologist, his
   own scholarly background allowed him to expand the sphere of problems
   dealt with as well as the range of thinkers involved in such critical
   discussions. To discuss those less known aspects of critical rationalism
   will be the task of this chapter.

AB Fortieth anniversaries of renaissance of the Slovak sociology that was
   destroyed by the commencing communist regime in the 1949 fall in the
   first decade of the third millennium. This period was marked by the
   birth of the Slovak Sociological Society (1964), Department of Sociology
   at the Faculty Arts, Comenius University in Bratislava (1964), Institute
   for Sociology of the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS) (1965) and of a
   journal of the Institute for Sociology of SAS - Sociologia in 1969.
   Before, sociological studies and research had been published in the
   journal Otazky marxistickej filozofie (Issues of Marxist Philosophy).
   The founding of journal Sociologia was aided by foreign sociologists
   such as Jan Szczepanski (then the president of International
   Sociological Association) and Ernest Gellner from London School of
   Economics. Membership in the editorial board was offered to sociologists
   from A. Stefanek's (founder of the Slovak sociology) generation, to his
   students and to a generation that graduated from the renewed Department
   of Sociology at the Faculty of Arts, Comenius University in Bratislava.
   Such intergenerational grouping of sociologists succeeded in developing
   a concept of a Slovak scientific periodical of a very high quality, even
   though it only lasted from 1969 to 1970. Coming era of normalization of
   the communist regime in the Czechoslovakia brought about radical changes
   in the concept pushed through by representatives of the scientific
   communism. Sociologia 2009, Vol. 41 (No. 1: 5-13)

   fulfilled in Vienna where the imperial authorities played an essential
   role. The Jesuits, who were considered the artisans of the union up to
   that moment, were reduced to the role of negotiators and forgers of the
   documents of 1697, 1698 and 1700. Because of the resentments against the
   "traitors" of the nation, S. Dragomir could not or did not want to
   understand the great change brought about in the history of
   Transylvanian Romanians by the political programme initiated by
   Inochentie. When we take into account the fact that Dragomir was one of
   the nationalists at the beginning of the 20th century in Transylvania,
   it is hard to understand his refusal to identify the birth of
   nationalism in Transylvania with the political action caused by the
   Greek-Catholic bishop. His historical writings were also influenced by
   the new political realities in Romania after 1944. The author hesitated
   to establish the causes of the religious movements led by Visarion Sarai
   and Sofronie of Cioara because he was influenced by the Marxist
   philosophy. In his interwar studies he thought the movements led by
   Visarion Sarai and Sofronie of Cioara had religious determinations and
   aimed at reestablishing the Orthodox faith. After 1955 the historian
   changed his conclusions, considering them social and national movements
   against the Hapsburgs

   1962 with the establishment of the Faculty of Political Sciences as the
   first academic institution of its kind in the then communist Central and
   Eastern Europe. Until the 1990s, this development was underpinned by two
   major factors. The first was the feud between the partisans and the
   opponents of political science as an independent discipline, which
   resulted in a compromise: the faculty was instituted as an organisation
   for the interdisciplinary study of economics, sociology, philosophy,
   history and political science. The second factor was the dominance of
   Marxist political science whose goal was to turn itself into an
   'anti-bourgeois', that is, anti-Western political science, even into a
   sort of an anti-political science.

   third section compares the two theories of ideology and shows that
   Barthes's insistence on the centrality of language allows him to offer a
   more comprehensive account of ideology: what begins in a form of
   allusion to Marxism ends up at a certain distance. The last section
   wonders what contribution Barthes's theory of ideosphere can make to a
   Marxist philosophy of language: one unexpected aspect of the answer
   makes use of the concept of style.

AB 'Beyond Cynicism' sets out to question the radical, or political,
   potential of the postmodernist philosophies which have underscored a
   significant strand of experimental performance over the last four
   decades. Rather than critiquing the postmodern from a Marxist or
   materialist perspective, the article returns to the self-deconstructive
   movement of Derrida to assess whether the capacity for political action
   and radical change is inherent within postmodernism itself.
   The article argues that the sceptical imperative, which is 'fundamental'
   to Derridean thought, contains the key to a constant self-reflexivity
   which prevents any 'totality' of conclusion being established. The
   logical consequence of this is that the 'conclusions' of the early
   postmodernists cannot be merely accepted by contemporary performance
   makers but must be rigorously and continually challenged in order to
   maintain the potential for political action and radical change.
   On the basis of this argument the article is able to make key
   distinctions between sceptical and cynical postmodern performance. It
   proposes that where Forced Entertainment's Showtime (1996) consistently
   questions its own scepticism by foregrounding the ghosts of the mimesis
   it simultaneously deconstructs, work which may have comparable 'motifs',
   such as Reckless Sleeper's Spanish Train (2006), presents only the
   foregone conclusions of the postmodern exercise, thus rejecting
   self-reflexivity to establish a new 'totality' which mirrors the
   'incommensurable narrative play' defined by Lyotard.
   The article concludes by examining the process and politics of 'making'
   self-reflexive performance, through an analysis of the author's own
   production of Roses Morphine (2005). This analysis highlights the
   importance of sustaining paradox in the making process, whereby the
   contradictions, which lie at the heart of the maker's own rhetorical
   operations, are exposed to ensure that conclusions are deconstructed
   even as they are reached.

AB Cultural studies is in a difficult position if it wants to find itself
   on the side of democracy against neo-liberalism in this age of
   ecological crisis. A great deal of the deconstructive,
   anti-essentialist, post-humanist, post-modernist thinking of recent
   decades has undermined the grounds upon which earlier generations
   understood the commodification of the world to be distasteful. In the
   absence of any normative conception of humanity, community, or nature,
   why not succumb to the deterritorializing thrill which the marketization
   of everything promises? The liberal defence of consumer culture which
   characterized a whole genre of work in cultural studies is clearly
   unable to answer this question, predicated as it is on a now wholly
   anachronistic critique of mid-century discourses of austerity,
   restraint, and patriarchal normativity.
   This might seem to leave us with a choice of either reverting to the
   prescriptive Marxism of pre-1960s cultural theory or accepting the job
   offered to us by the neo-liberal university: of training smart,
   reflexive, ironic hedonists to work and consume efficiently in the
   knowledge economy. However, there is another way. An attentive and
   nuanced reading of post-structuralist and post-Marxist philosophy, as
   well as older resources for cultural theory, can provide the basis for a
   democratic and anti-essentialist critique of consumerism as a normative
   paradigm which erases difference and silences political discussion by
   the violent imposition of particular modes of relationality (in
   particular that of the customer/seller relationship) on every social
   scene. It is from the perspective of a politics which tries to keep open
   the possibility of other, multiple modes of relationality, rather than
   one which wishes to impose a singular utopian blueprint on the future,
   that cultural studies can play a useful role in critiquing the hegemony
   of consumerism and competitive individualism without succumbing to the
   temptations of too much socialist nostalgia.

   effort into the philosophical analysis of social phenomena (in an

AB The essay takes its point of departure from Monod's reading of
   dialectical materialism in Chance and Necessity. A passage of Engels's
   Dialectics of Nature, which identifies Spinoza's concept of causa sui
   with the Hegelian concept of interaction [Wechselwirkung], provides the
   opportunity to examine the consequences of Monod's claims more closely.
   Using Spinoza's philosophy as a litmus test, the essay attempts to
   demonstrate the debt of Engels's materialism to Hegel's Science of Logic
   by tracing the development of the concept of Wechselwirkung in classical
   German philosophy. A profound difference between the Spinozan and
   Hegelian concepts becomes apparent: while the concept of Wechselwirkung
   implies a totality present to itself as simultaneity, permitting the
   flow of a linear, homogenous and empty time upon which stages of
   development can be inscribed, the concept of causa sui implies a
   totality without closure, a totality whose eternity is identified with
   the necessary and infinite network of modal durations. The essay
   concludes by suggesting that Spinoza's concept of causa sui allows us to
   rethink the relation between freedom and necessity in the Marxist
   tradition in conjunctural and aleatory terms.

   discipline which in its Marxist form had been regarded as an ideological
   basis of the Soviet rule took a vigorous part in political activities
   aiming at liberation from that rule. With this aim in mind, analysis of
   the situation of philosophy in occupied Lithuania is presented. A
   special emphasis is put on the situation at Vilnius University. An
   attempt is being made to explain why and in which respect it was
   different from that at other universities in the Soviet Union. The
   factors that were responsible for a relatively high reputation of
   philosophers among Lithuanian reading public are examined. Exactly that
   high reputation and the developed sense of responsibility explains why
   philosophers were so eager to join the popular movement aiming at the
   liberation of Lithuania, were able to become its distinguished leaders
   and play a very important role in the political rebirth and the
   consolidation of the regained independence. Some issues related to the
   periodization of the development of Lithuanian philosophy during the

AB Considerations of philosopher and social anthropologists Edmundas
   Gendrolis (1938-1994) about self-imagination and self-understanding of
   human beings from the point of social and cultural anthropology and
   paleoanthropology are analyzed. Gendrolis supported his considerations
   by theories and methodologies, researches of social and cultural
   anthropology, paleoanthropology, ethology, Marxist philosophy. The aim
   of the article is to show the specificity of his philosophical
   anthropological considerations, especially of theory of communitarian
   ideation, development of conscious solidarity, cultural continuity from
   the time of Homo erectus. The article shows that Gendrolis moderately
   criticized the Marxist theory of work, zoological individualism, linear
   evolutionarism, Eurocentrism, racism and cultural segregation. He tried
   to resist the colonial and neocolonial tendencies in anthropological
   discourses and to support common postcolonial attitudes to the history
   of tribes and small nations. On the contrary, he developed ideas of E
   Boas, multilinear cultural Evolutionarism, ideas of L. A. White, M.
   Sahlins, E. R. Service and the dialectical approach to the complexity of
   issues of the human being. Such issues are morphological changes of
   paleoanthropos and neoanthropos, domestic life and household, exogamy
   and taboo, totems and early forms of faith, tools of the work and art
   pictures. He tried to develop the humanistic approach to the Homo
   erectus and Neanderthals as the basis for the future humanistic
   interpretation of traditional tribes and small nations. Such
   considerations corresponded to the Lithuanian world conception and to
   the attempts to liberate themselves from the Soviet occupation and
   Soviet cultural hegemony.
   He maintained the main subject of self-comprehending thinking to be
   community and its skills of cooperation and ideation. Ideation is the
   process of forming and relating ideas, images and ideals. The process of
   ideation, the making of abstract solutions and conceptual memory depends
   on community network, trust, solidarity that could be supported by

   Ideation influenced the skills of hunters, pickers, formed wedding
   rules, trade among the modern Homini sapiens. And vice versa: all human
   activities supported and developed the process of abstract thinking and
   collective ideation. The integral approach to the issues of human being
   and the theory of multilinear evolution of them became the basis for
   criticism of Marxist anthropology. He criticized Marxism as well as
   social Darwinism and any other evolutionism as too much teleological,
   deterministic and dogmatic theories.
   His other critical point is about zoological individualism which
   accumulates a lot of negative interpretations of savages and provides
   cultural aggression.
   However, Gendrolis stayed alone from the European social or cultural
   anthropological movement, and his very large and quite deep
   considerations didn't become the beginning of the institutional
   development of social or cultural anthropological studies in Lithuania.
   He developed a very little dialog with local ethnologists, and it was
   the reason for narrow interpretations of his theories. However, his
   books, articles and ideas are interesting and actual for modern social
   and philosophical anthropologists.

TI TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE POETICS OF CHAOS IN POLISH, CZECH AND SLOVAK
   CULTURAL CONTEXT
SO SLOVAK REVIEW OF WORLD LITERATURE RESEARCH
VL 17

PD 2008

AB In the overview study the author outlines "the poetics of chaos", which
   is programmatically present in Polish, Czech and Slovak cultural context
   approximately from the 1960s. He also asks whether this term can be
   understood as a legitimate and a correct literary-aesthetic category or
   whether we should rather speak about an estranging metaphor which arches
   over the problematic of dynamic, non-linear and pulsating structures.
   Although it is a term describing processes in natural sciences (quantum
   physics, deterministic chaos and fractal geometry) it is gradually
   emerging in human sciences (especially in philosophy, aesthetics and
   literary science).
   In a short historical sketch, the author of the study follows the
   beginnings of this poetics in modern art, in the avant-garde, in
   formalism and in Czech structuralism. He considers Mukarovsky's article
   Intentionality and Non-Intentionality in Art (Zamernost a nezamernost v
   umeni) to be the key text in which Mukarovsky argues that a work of art
   as a whole is not only a product of an intentional creative process but
   of many things that transcend intentionality. Mukarovsky's text paves
   the way to "the poetics of chaos". By the same token, chaos can bee seen
   as something in the background, as a contrasting and at the same time a
   complementary element to order (chaos and order are always present).
   The author directs attention to two studies from the 1960s. The first
   one is J. Bartos' Category of the Accidental in the History of
   Philosophical Thinking (Kategorie nahodileho v dejinach filosofickeho
   mysleni, 1965) which similarly to Kosik's Dialectics of Concrete
   (Dialektika konkretniho, 1966) develops the Marxist philosophy,
   previously tied to the ideological dogmatism of the 1950s. The second
   study is Stanislaw Lem's Philosophy of Chance (Filozofia przypadku,
   1968) whose philosophical impact not only closes up the temporal context
   but also creates the theoretical point for the present thinking of "the
   aesthetics of chaos" as well as the deconstruction or post-structural
   ism.
   The article further explores the influence of "the poetics of chaos" on
   theoretical thinking in the 1980s and in the 1990s. In Czech cultural
   context it is the collection of papers Geometry of the Living (Geometrie
   ziveho, 1989), D. Hodova's ... at the edge of chaos... (... na okraji
   chaosu..., 2001), and in Slovakia O. Cepan's Literary-theoreical
   Articles (Literarnoteoreticke state, 2003) and R Zajac' Pulsation of
   Literature (Pulzovanie literatury, 1993). The author also notes the
   present development in Poland where Humanists about Chaos Theory
   (Humanisci wobec teorii chaosu, 2006) and Rafal Koschany's monograph
   Chance (Przypadek, 2006) appeared.
   From the diachronic point of view the author calls the attention to the
   oscillatory character of this poetics. There are periods in which the
   need for a formal and semantic unification stresses the basic creative
   principle. At other times this formal and semantic unity is disturbed.
   The preference for aesthetic categories which are closer to "the poetics
   of chaos" is typical of transitory periods. After they have gradually
   faded, came the need for synthesis, harmony and wholeness.

AB S. Weil's relationship to Marxism is paradoxical because it unveils a
   loyalty to Marx in spite of ruptures and renunciations of the Marxist
   theory. S. Weil's ties to Marxism seem discontinuous because after
   having adopted certain revolutionary ideas during her first years of
   political activism she criticizes Marx in the 30's and ends up seemingly
   abandoning him in the last part of her fife. This path, however, far
   from revealing the slow and inexorable disappearance of Marx's concepts,
   rather, demonstrates the persistence and metamorphoses in S. Weil's
   philosophy. We suggest then, that a criticism of the revolution followed
   by a kind of Christianity developed in the wake of a year spent in the
   factory, constitute S. Weil's own special manner of being Marxist, even
   though Marxism seems to have become useless to her.

AB In the Prison Notebooks there is a critique of sociology that leads to
   the elaboration of a "science of politics". In this essay, it is argued
   how this critique -that starts off as political intervention in the
   context of the Third International- is related to the main points of
   Gramsci's reflection, as the relationship between theory and politics
   (and the status of theory), and between philosophy and ideology, the
   concepts of historical necessity, law and science. It is shown how the
   result of the research is not, for Gramsci, mainly the rebuttal of the
   idea of a social legality, but the redefinition of the law in terms of
   "regularity", a notion in which political will and economic necessity
   are synthesised.

AB This article explores the significance of anti-totalitarian humanism for
   contemporary moral and social philosophy, with special reference to the
   thinking of Emmanuel Levinas (1906-1995). Special use is made of Tzvetan
   Todorov's (1939) work "Hope and memory" to clarify the framework within
   which anti-totalitarian humanism takes shape, and also to shed light. on
   the relation, similarities and disagreements between the totalitarian
   utopianism that characterized twentieth century fascist regimes, and
   other versions and residues of the utopian tradition, such as we
   encounter in Levinas and the early generation of Neo-Marxist
   philosophers. Levinas' attempt in his early works to develop a humanism
   that is founded in both everyday material existence and interpersonal
   relationships is then examined in closer detail. Interpretations of the
   utopian significance of his phenomenological notions such as death, time
   and sociality, Messianic hope, despair and moral repair are offered. It
   is emphasized that Levinas' early notion of innerworldly bliss
   constitutes a utopian core in his thought that is to be separate from
   the notion of innerworldly bliss that characterizes totalitarian
   utopianism, and also undermines the philosophical foundations of
   totalitarian utopianism.

   political stakes involved in his philosophical project, nor the way in
   which this project evolved from a 'theoreticist' pursuit into a more

AB The Belgian physicist Leon Rosenfeld (1904-1974) has been called "the
   clarifier" of Niels Bohr's ideas in quantum mechanics. He had a unique
   connection to Bohr as his close collaborator from 1930 until Bohr died
   in 1962. However, although he is considered Bohr's spokesman, he had his
   own characteristic way of articulating Bohr's views. In particular,
   Rosenfeld added a dialectical-materialist layer to Bohr's ideas in
   certain contexts. Despite Rosenfeld's open profession of Marxism, the
   literature has generally avoided discussing its relevance for his work
   and activities. This paper suggests some reasons why and investigates
   Rosenfeld's combination of Marxism and complementarity, which his
   colleague and friend Wolfgang Pauli metaphorically denoted by the
   equation "Rosenfeld =root TrotskyXBohr" Rosenfeld's particular views
   appear anomalous to the frequently expressed stereotypes of both Marxism
   and complementarity. The paper concentrates on the role Marxist
   philosophy played in Rosenfeld's fierce defense of complementarity from
   the late 1940s through the 1950s and the reception his campaign was
   accorded at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and elsewhere.

AB When one conceives of historical events as "signs of the times", one
   connects the focus on the past with the focus on the future. This can be
   achieved in several ways. From the view-point of Christianity, Idealist
   philosophy, and Marxist ideology, the "signs of the times" presage a
   state of humanity that is anticipated to be the final one; positivistic
   approaches to history, on the other hand, follow the example of the
   natural sciences in proceeding from antecedent conditions and using laws
   of nature to derive predictions about the future course of things, while
   the Enlightenment approach to history subjects historical prognosis to
   moral maxims which are treated as valid a priori. In all these cases,
   taking given events as "signs of the times" amounts to integrating them
   into a well-established knowledge system which serves to define
   pre-conceived human conditions for the coming stages of human history.

AB In his critique of my book Heidegger and Marcuse, Jeff Kochan (2006)
   asserts that I am committed to the possibility of private knowledge,
   transcendent truths, and individualism. In this reply I argue that he
   has misinterpreted my analysis of the Challenger disaster and Marcuse's
   work. Because I do not dismiss Roger Boisjoly's doubts about the
   Challenger launch, Kochan believes that I have abandoned a social
   concept of knowledge for a reliance on the private knowledge of a single
   individual. In fact, I consider Boisjoly's observations just as social,
   if not as scientific, as the results of rigorous scientific study.
   Kochan's reliance on a principle of symmetry derived from science
   studies to explain such politically charged technological controversies
   tends to mask the role of power and ideology in social life. Kochan
   interprets Marcuse as a failed Heideggerian who regresses from
   Heidegger's social conception of human being to traditional
   individualism. I am accused of sharing this view. This interpretation
   overlooks the importance of the Hegelian-Marxist category of 'real
   possibility' in Marcuse's work and so mistakes his critique of
   conformist politics for individualist romanticism. Marcuse always
   attempted to ground radical opposition in a community of struggle
   without abandoning the heritage of a long critical tradition. This view
   I willingly share. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this article, John Holst presents findings of his historical research
   on Paulo Freire's educational work in Chile from 1964 to 1969. Freire's
   Education as the Practice of Freedom, which was written in 1965 from
   notes he brought from Brazil, was informed by a liberal developmentalist
   outlook. In contrast, his Pedagogy of the Oppressed, written toward the
   end of his stay in Chile from 1967 to 1968, was influenced by Marxist
   humanist ideology. Considering this relatively rapid change in Freire's
   educational philosophy, Hoist explores the manner in which Freire's time
   and work in Chile affected his ideological evolution. Hoist contributes
   to Freirean studies by demonstrating that Freire's work in the Chilean
   political context proved to be decisive in his ideological and
   pedagogical growth. Freire's ideological evolution inspired his writing
   of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, widely considered one of the most
   important books on education in the twentieth century. Ultimately, Hoist
   argues that Freire's pedagogy, like all pedagogy, can only be understood
   fully when seen within the specific sociopolitical and economic contexts
   within which it developed. Pedagogies are collective in nature, and
   Freire's, as he himself recognized, was no exception.

   means to be an insurgent intellectual-activist (one who relates critical
   theory to radical political praxis). Du Bois has been hailed as an
   historian, sociologist, Marxist, and political activist but never an
   early interdisciplinary social theorist with concrete political
   commitments to not simply Black liberation and racial justice but to
   women's liberation, the poor masses and working classes, and colonized

   scholars who have interpreted and reinterpreted his work, often
   overlooking its deep critical theoretical dimensions. In this article,
   Du Bois's multifarious and ever-evolving social theory is situated at

   and Conquerors: A Critical Pedagogy Against Empire. The essay situates
   McLaren's work in the philosophical tradition of Marxist Humanism, with
   reference specifically to Raya Dunayevskaya and Paulo Freire. Despite
   invoking the work of Dunayevskaya as a foundation for his own project,
   McLaren does not offer a robust explication of this important thinker,
   nor of the Hegelian-Marxist discourse she embraced. Here, as in much of
   McLaren's work, the reader is not offered rigorous analysis of his
   philosophical assumptions. The dearth of such analysis, this essay
   argues, compromises the critical thrust of McLaren's work. In turn, the
   essay sketches a framework for unpacking the Marxist Humanist paradigm,
   and, thereby, rethinking the philosophical foundations of contemporary
   critical pedagogy.

   imperialist center. The author further stresses individual
   self-appropriation and the critique of imperialism through a Marxist
   understanding of surplus value (as arising from labor time for which
   workers are not paid). There is a link between capitalistic imperialism
   and militarism, and President Bush has made illegitimate use of religion
   in the attempt to legitimate empire. Liberation is the good and the
   happiness that together result from doing the work of justice, free from
   capitalist corruption. In challenging capitalist empire, we ought to aim
   for the "downward mobility" of a simpler lifestyle, where
   self-appropriation leads to moral, religious, and practical conversion.
   An inhumane, capitalist society is fundamentally at odds with us as
   human beings, as philosophers, and as Christians.

AB Although first published in 1941 Herbert Marcus' "Some Implications of
   Modem Technology" (published in Studies in Philosophy and Social
   Sciences) suggested that the modern machine age with its' efficiency
   fetish has substituted for commodity fetish at the hands of an
   authoritarian state. A typical Marxist ideology of the old left during
   that period of time.
   However, many of the implications located in postmodern technology
   Marcus failed to see as a volunteristic behavior, mainly due to the time
   span between the modem and postmodern age. Predominate among these
   effects is the loss of individuality.
   Today the impact of the computer age leads to standardization of
   thought, social conformity, and should be seen as a volunteristic social
   by-product of the nature of advanced technology, and not the tool of an
   authoritarian state. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines the pre-history of Alasdair MacIntyre's
   contemporary moral philosophy. In the 1950s and 1960s MacIntyre was a
   leading member of the British New Left, from whence he gravitated
   towards a form of heterodox Trotskyism. During this period he began to
   formulate a Marxist ethics which both compares with and informs the
   thesis of his magnum opus After Virtue. As the conclusion of After
   Virtue is premised upon a dismissal of Marxism, it is of some interest
   to explore the exact route through which MacIntyre came to replace his
   earlier with his later framework. The article, after reconstructing
   MacIntyre's Marxist ethics, traces the trajectory through which he came
   to reject Marxism, and shows that while MacIntyre's mature critique of
   Marxism first took shape in the 1960s, his political pessimism was built
   upon two assumptions - that Marx's economic theory was outdated and that
   a defensible theory of human nature did not exist - which he has
   recently questioned. The conclusion is that MacIntyre's rethinking of
   these assumptions has opened a space for a renewed dialogue between
   himself and Marxists.

AB Spencer's evolutionary philosophy is usually identified with right-wing
   doctrines such as individualism, laissez-faire liberalism and even
   conservatism. Since he himself defended similar positions, it is perhaps
   not surprising that the study of the political interpretations of his
   ideas has drawn relatively little attention. In this article I propose
   to examine a rather atypical reading of Spencer's organic analogy,
   though definitely not a marginal one: Enrico Ferri's Marxist doctrine of
   Scientific Socialism. Ferri is not a figure unknown to scholars
   interested in the political aspects of the evolutionary debate.
   Nonetheless, the relation between his theory and Spencer's bio-sociology
   - notably the complex dialectic of themes such as "the struggle for
   existence" versus "class struggle," or "evolution" versus "revolution" -
   has not yet received full-length analysis. In my study I investigate the
   diffusion of Spencer's ideas in Italy and their impact on the new
   "positivist" sciences of psychology and sociology inasmuch as these
   questions are essential to understanding Ferri's position. Throughout, I
   stress the importance of the intellectual and political context in the
   process of appropriation of ideas that led to this unexpected shift in
   meaning.

AB The present article reviews, from a critical, theoretical standpoint,
   the 'semiotic of Culture' that leading colonialist Walter Mignolo
   undertook to construct in his early works. These works combined
   classical structuralism, which promotes an objective approach to
   literature, with its inverted, equally positivist counterpart,
   hermeneutics, which foregrounds the role of the subject. Both projects
   collapse at the point where they run up against the existence of an
   all-encompassing 'ideology'. Their underlying ahistorical, neo-Kantian
   idealism secretly nurtures a 'resistance to theory', based on a flawed
   philosophy of science. We play off this neo-Kantian idealism at all
   points against the critical realism of Althusserian Marxism, which
   theorizes the notion of an 'ideological unconscious'. On the latter's
   terms, as expounded by the Marxist scholar, Juan Carlos Rodriguez, not
   all ideological discourses operate, historically, through the category
   of the subject. The epic, essay and autobiography serve to illustrate
   the contrasting critical approaches under review.

AB This paper considers the legacy of Derrida's thought in the context of
   the future challenge of contemporary politics: the construction of world
   polity. It rehearses, first, the steps of the recent 'reconciliation'
   between Jurgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida, and suggests, from out of
   the terms of this reconciliation, that the deconstruction of reason has
   been caught out by the contemporary movements of irrationalism. It then
   deepens this historical viewpoint by giving a neo-Marxist account of
   modem history in economic and political terms and by setting up from out
   of this history the continuing problematic of modernity above and beyond
   recent distinctions between the modern and the postmodern. The third
   section of the paper returns to Derrida's late work on world democracy,
   underlines its critical rigour with regard to modernity, the dilemma of
   law and world sovereignty, and shows how this rigor can be considered to
   address critically our future political challenge. The fourth section
   then contends that the way in which Derridean thought disposes itself to
   the real but nevertheless occludes concerted development of our
   historical actuality and, in this sense, falls short of the critical. I
   conclude, accordingly, by arguing for a renewed engagement between
   critical philosophy and social science, with a focus on the promotion of
   international institutions and strong interdisciplinary work between
   international relations, international economics, and political
   philosophy.

AB Philosophy related social science, like two wheels of a cart and two
   wings of a bird as pointed out by President Hu Jintao are as important
   as natural science. As such conclusion is also applied to Yellow River
   harnessing field, it is necessary to attach great importance to the
   development of philosophy related social science in the cause of Yellow
   River harnessing to realize the historical task of "keeping healthy life
   of the Yellow River".
   The wide applications of philosophy related social science to guidelines
   of Yellow River harnessing, strategic research, management of Yellow
   River harnessing course, social evaluation of projects, treatment of
   Yellow River according to law and propaganda work etc. provide strong
   support in thoughts, spirits and wits to the development of various
   causes. Since the time of harnessing Yellow River, remarkable
   achievements have been made in the field of philosophy related social
   science by Yellow River Conservancy Commission such as establishment of
   the guiding status of Marxist philosophy; studying strategic problems of
   Yellow River harnessing with the notion of social science; great
   enhancement of legal consciousness of Yellow River harnessing teams;
   establishment of media system composed of newspaper, net magazine and
   television. Remarkable results have been achieved in the research on
   water history. However, what is more wanted for philosophy related
   social science of Yellow River Conservancy Commission is shown in the
   following aspects: lack of scientific development program; lack of
   inspiration mechanism; lack of subject bellwether and lack of propaganda
   base. Measures taken for the further prosperity and development of
   philosophy related social science are: unalterably using Marxist
   philosophy to guide Yellow River practice; establishing subject program;
   setting up initiation mechanism; building propaganda base and training a
   colony of subject bellwether.
   Overall, philosophy related social science is an important part in
   Yellow River harnessing cause and if such cause could be developed
   quickly, it would hover like having a pair of forceful wings in the sky
   in promoting Yellow River harnessing and development and management
   modernization.

AB This article introduces and analyses recent developments in philosophy
   of education in mainland China and Taiwan. Though Confucianism has very
   rich insights into education, philosophy of education as a discipline
   came to China only around 100 years ago. It reached its first climax in
   the 1920s and 1930s, but then went into decline for nearly half a
   century. In the meantime, western trained philosophers of education were
   gaining influence in Taiwan from 1949. After the epoch of the Cultural
   Revolution and implementation of the open door policy, a revival of
   philosophy of education occurred in the 1980s, combining the long
   ruptured Confucian tradition and western philosophy of education with a
   reconceptualization of Marxist educational ideas. Though western
   traditions remain dominant, especially in Taiwan, Confucianism, Taoism,
   Buddhism and neo-Confucianism have all been taken as frameworks in
   developing educational theories. It is argued, in conclusion, that what
   is needed is to make a real marriage between traditional Confucianism
   and western philosophy of education.

AB Mathematicians and traditional pure mathematics in the U.S.S.R. came
   under attack in the 1930s from the platforms of religion and nationalism
   in attempts to establish dialectical materialist mathematics. These
   platforms came to light at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist
   Party in 1930. A leader of the attacks was the mathematically inclined
   Marxist/Stalinist ideolog Ernst Kolman (1892-1979), in whose writings
   randomness and probability (more amenable to philosophical discourse
   than other areas of mathematics) are recurring issues. The recently
   rediscovered booklet Mathematics and Religion, written in 1933 under the
   influence of Kolman by the mathematician and political activist Mikhail
   Kh. Orlov (1900-1936), encompasses the Bolshevik position on mathematics
   and religion. A nucleus of vilification in Orlov's book for his
   religiously inclined pre-revolutionary writings is the mathematician
   Pavel Alekseevich Nekrasov (1853-1924), and by extension, the Moscow
   Mathematical Society, a focus of attack by Kolman and others. The
   attacks, and especially the probabilistic aspects are studied below
   under a sequence of headings: Mathematics and the 16th Party Congress;
   Moscow Mathematical Society; Nekrasov's Probability and Social Physics;
   Politically Correct Probability; Politically Correct Statistics?; Orlov,
   Religion, and Mathematics; Orlov and Kolman on Religion and Mathematics.
   There are biographical appendices on Kolman and Orlov. The outstanding
   mathematician/probabilists of the time, Andrei N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)
   and Sergei N. Bernstein (1880-1968), were prominent among the obstacles
   to the "reforms" of Kolman (in Moscow) and Orlov (in Ukraine),
   respectively, and feature in this study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All

   claim is that, on the contrary, this is the case at neither level. More
   precisely, he seeks to show that the two most innovative currents of
   contemporary Marxism, the Frankfurt School and rational-choice Marxism,
   have recently evolved in a convergent manner towards a relinquishment of
   the reference to Marxism. At the same time, both these theoretical
   developments allow for new - and non-Marxist - instruments for the
   understanding of contemporary social movements and the formulation of
   new forms of political philosophy, which are themselves still
   surprisingly convergent. The path followed by Jurgen Habermas is
   particularly representative of the first of these currents; John Elster
   is a significant representative of the second.

AB This article explores two related questions. First, why has Marxist
   social theory been in sharp decline? Second, is Marxism still of value
   as a source of explanatory insights in the contemporary period? The
   author addresses the first question in terms of Marxism's decline as a
   specific resource in the study of China and as a general mode of
   analysis within social science and he provides a number of
   interconnected reasons, based primarily in the sociology of knowledge.
   These reasons for decline allow the argument to be made that Marxism
   still has something to offer because none of the reasons necessarily
   entails that Marxist concepts need lack explanatory relevance. This
   leads into the second question where the author explores how the realist
   movement in philosophy has been used by Marxists to provide an
   analytical underpinning that is compatible with Marx's work and where
   the author also discusses some aspects of contemporary China in terms of
   Marxist ways of thinking. These are then placed in an international
   context. The argument is part of a wider project to develop an applied
   philosophy of area studies.

AB This article argues that the work of Martin Heidegger is extremely
   important in understanding Henri Lefebvre's intellectual project. It
   suggests that Lefebvre's trio of influential thinkers-Hegel, Marx and
   Nietzsche- are partnered by Heidegger. But this is Heidegger read in a
   particular way, and subjected to a Marxist critique-turned back on his
   feet, grounded, made real.
   This is pursued in detail through a rereading of Lefebvre's The
   Production of Space. The two terms in this title need to be examined,
   and while the importance of space develops a number of insights from
   Heidegger, the stress on production shows the political and Marxist
   nature of this research. The Production of Space is therefore situated,
   and needs to be read, between Marx and Heidegger. The article closes
   with some comments on the interrelation of history, space and politics,
   and offers the possibility of a left-Heideggerianism.

AB Charles Taylor's engagement with Marx and the Marxist tradition has been
   relatively neglected in the literature on his work. This is a strange
   omission, because he was not only a pivotal figure in the development of
   the New Left, but also wrote many pieces which critically engaged with
   the main principles of Marx and Marxism. This paper re-examines Taylor's
   engagement with Marxism and thereby exposes a neglected element in his
   political philosophy. The following themes emerge: the self; Taylor's
   conception of the affirmation of ordinary life; democracy; ecology; and
   religion. In one area at least, the affirmation of ordinary life, a
   crucial element of Marxism is retained and positively endorsed by
   Taylor. in relation to the other themes, while he raises important
   issues for Marxist theory, he is, at times, far too quick to dismiss
   Marx's arguments and also misses similarities between those arguments
   and his own work.

   Marxist-feminist analysis of recent shifts in adult education and

   learning organization in the capitalist political economy, the location
   of workers in relation to the learning organization, and the role of
   learning rhetoric in maintaining the status quo. This study argues that
   the learning organization model can be seen both as a mechanism for the
   extraction of surplus value from workers and as a method of social
   control. The learning organization model is often associated with
   progressive, even emancipatory, claims of inclusion and collaboration in
   the workplace. However, this study argues that the educational legacies

   better places to seek the learning interests of the workers that make up

AB This article contends that Georg Simmel attempted a rehabilitation of
   the Jewish stereotype in a singular way: via his theory of modernity and
   the quintessential place held therein by money. The first part of the
   article, based almost entirely on Simmel's The Philosophy of Money,
   seeks to demonstrate that Simmel intended to overturn the negative
   Aristotelian and Marxist assessments of money and of those who deal with
   it. The second part of the article is based on Simmel's unique theory of
   type. This part seeks to establish that what Simmel in fact
   rehabilitates is the Jewish type, rather than any actual historical
   entity, and that this type is in fact the stereotype of the Jew.
   Simmel's attempt is made in terms of existential authenticity (i.e.
   truth and beauty) and in direct relation to the project of modernity
   (money).

AB Although Marx's labor theory of value is widely considered to be central
   to his critique of political economy, both hostile and sympathetic
   critics have continuously challenged the theory. The well-known
   critiques of Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk and John Roemer have been disputed by
   several authors working in the tradition of Marxist philosophy. A
   different type of counter-argument, however, sticks as closely as
   possible to Bohm-Bawerk's and Roemer's own method. This immanent
   critique shows that they fail to refute the labor-value postulate even
   in their own terms. This immanent critique should be seen as
   supplementing, rather than replacing, existing counter-arguments.

AB In this narrative analysis of two Soviet dissertations in philosophy I
   discuss the role of Solov'ev as one of the major characters in the
   Soviet academic narration of Russian philosophy: I show how the authors
   (Turenko and Spirov) cope with the necessity of criticizing Solov'ev
   from the Marxist position and protect him from Western scholars as the
   latter attempted to revise Russian philosophy. I also discuss the way in
   which this requirement both to criticize and protect is represented in
   the dissertations in which the strong Marxist posture and loyalty to
   communist doctrine corresponded to the authors' belief that Solov'ev was
   a great philosopher who made mistakes, although his philosophy remains a
   part of Russia's cultural heritage. The main conclusion is that in spite
   of their vision of the world as split into the communist and bourgeois
   camps, both authors try to avoid straightforward Manichean assessments
   and, in 60s and 70s, were keen to find as many positive elements in
   Solov'ev's philosophy as possible.

AB Across debates within political and international theory similar demands
   have been made concerning the need to 'historicize' the theoretical and
   practical legacy of the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci. Yet little
   attention has been hitherto granted to the substantive ontological and
   epistemological basis of such demands. By outlining a series of
   interpretative controversies and examining in detail the question of
   historicizing Gramsci, this article addresses some of the principal
   demands to historicize Gramsci before discerning any contemporary
   relevance. By tackling such demands within their own terms and according
   to their own stipulations an immanent critique is developed. This tactic
   of an immanent critique offers an approach to the history of ideas
   useful to the present, it locates ideas both in and beyond their
   context, and it also pushes one to consider what might be historically
   limited in a theoretical and practical translation of past ideas in
   relation to alternative conditions.

AB The history of Slovak philosophy can be reconstructed along two basic
   lines: along the line of the school (academic) philosophy, developed at
   existing high schools, colleges and universities, as well as along the
   other line - that of philosophical (social) thinking. The researches
   should focus not only on professional philosophy, but also on the forms
   of applied (and also implicit) philosophical thinking as a part of the
   community's culture. The standpoint of the researches should be
   non-ideological, non-national, non-ethnical. "The Slovak philosophy" is
   related to all philosophical expressions, historically present in Slovak
   region or in Slovak culture. This option as an alternative to previous
   paradigmatic scheme, used by Marxist historiography. It represents a
   methodological issue par excellence, demanding a special attention and
   also theoretical and methodological selfreflection of the historians of
   philosophy.

   author's point is, that A. Siracky as a representative of Slovak
   intellectual elite also took part in this process, enforced from the
   outside. In spite of certain criticism against Marxist dogmatism he
   himself in his conception pursued consequently a dogma, according to
   which both sociology and philosophy are ideological disciplines.

   points are two important tensions in critical realism. The first tension
   relates generally to the status and importance of philosophy and the
   scope of critical realism. The second tension relates specifically to
   critical realism in political economy. Firstly, two perspectives within
   critical realism in political economy are separated: a Marxist current
   and a broad heterodox current. Secondly, these two perspectives within
   critical realism are contrasted and discussed on the basis of a critical
   stance towards philosophical reductionism. Thirdly, it is argued that
   reconciliation between central aspects of the two perspectives is both
   feasible and desirable, and finally, neo-Marxist political economy is
   pinpointed as a critical-constructive and developmental mediation for
   critical realism in political economy.

AB This article examines Hegel's view of love in his "early theological
   writing," "The Spirit of Christianity and Its Fate," where he saw love
   as a basis of autonomy in the modem self which could overcome the
   divisions between reason and emotion, self and other and finite and
   infinite. The article also examines Hegel's attempt in the essay to come
   to grips with why a community of love cannot be sustained by modem
   individuals. Consideration of this essay is seen to be valuable because
   of the insight it offers into the nature of the modem subjectivity. Even
   more importantly, it throws a different perspective on the mature Hegel.
   Contrary to the feminist view of Hegel as basing his political community
   on a reason that is exclusive of love and intuition, and the Marxist
   view of him as building the political community upon the abstract
   labouring will, this article argues for the ongoing importance of love
   in Hegel's mature political philosophy. Furthermore, it suggests that
   the need to protect and preserve the knowledge of love from the
   eclipsing effects of a narrow instrumental reasoning was an essential
   motive in the development of Hegel's mature philosophical system.

AB This paper advances a theory as to why Vygotsky's research program has
   remained at the center of international psychological debates, despite
   its grounding in Marxist philosophy. An important part of the
   psychological appeal of Vygotsky derives from the fact that lie was
   describing the mental constructs and rule-governed behavior of human
   development in their account of social, cultural, and historical
   reality. There have been a number of attempts to create a Marxist
   psychology during the 1920s and 1930s. These have been less successful
   because of misunderstandings of Marxism, and indeed of psychology. If
   Marxism drew on German Hegelian philosophy, British political economy,
   and French political socialism, then psychology drew on German
   materialist physiology, British empiricist philosophy, and French
   Cartesian dualism. Marx attacked the poverty of philosophy and wrote a
   Critique of political economy, similarly, Vygotsky wrote Educational
   psychology and attacked the poverty of psychology in his magnum opus,
   Historical Meaning of the Crisis in Psychology. Vygotsky argued that we
   must write our poverty of psychology, then lay the foundations for a
   Marxist psychology. That is to create psychology's own capital.

AB The longstanding philosophical debate between idealism and materialism
   has recently entered the ontological terrain of critical realism (CR)
   and dialectical critical realism (DCR). This has been initiated by Roy
   Bhaskar's most recent book, From East to West, which attempts an
   ambitious synthesis of philosophy, social theory and theology. On die
   one hand, Bhaskar's attempt to root his philosophy and social theory in
   a 'realist theory of God' has found an echo within the CR and DCR
   research camp, some of whose members would urge us to take seriously the
   possibility of a 'religious sociology'. On the other hand, Bhaskar's
   abrupt 'idealist turn' has left many critical realists flabbergasted and
   horrified, particularly those working at the interface between realist
   philosophy and Marxist social science, especially since Bhaskar's new
   philosophical trajectory is radically at odds with the 'synchronic
   emergent powers materialism' outlined in his The Possibility of
   Naturalism.
   In response to this 'split' within the CR and DCR camp, the spectre of
   'realist agnosticism' has been raised and defended by Mervyn Hartwig in
   this journal. Since neither science nor philosophy can settle the issue
   of what kind of stuff constitutes 'rock bottom reality', it is rational
   to be agnostic on the 'ultimate question'. to deny positively affirming
   the claims of either one side or the other. Now this is the move that is
   resisted in this paper. My argument is that ontological idealism is
   disputable on a number of grounds-philosophical, scientific, ethical and
   political. In particular, I argue that objective idealism is unsupported
   by rational knowledge, is riddled with conceptual and logical defects,
   is contrary to the logic of scientific discovery, and is an obstacle to
   eudaimonia (human emancipation). Further, since realist agnosticism
   rests its case on the myth of infallible knowledge, and obviously stands
   or falls with the defensibility or otherwise of objective idealism, this
   gives us 'good enough' reasons for accepting a thoroughgoing materialism
   as the ontological foundation of social theory.

AB With the destruction of the Soviet Union and the fail of the Communist

   revolution unparalleled in suddenness and scope. Among the salient
   features of this revolution are the displacement of Marxism from Its
   former, virtually monopolistic status to a distinctly subordinate and
   widely scorned position: the rediscovery of Russia's pre-Marxist and
   anti-Marxist philosophers. in particular the religious thinkers of the
   past two centuries: Increasing interest in Western philosophical
   traditions that were neglected or condemned during the Soviet period;
   and special attention to the philosophy of culture, with particular
   reference to the role of philosophy in the national culture of Russia.
   In all of these new directions, a recurring and controversial theme is
   the widely perceived need for a new "Russian idea." or something to
   "fill the ideological vacuum" left by the demise of Russian Marxism.

   rejects forms of economic determinism such as the base-superstructure

   productive forces in explaining history and society. It argues instead
   that society is the product of complex, often contradictory combinations
   of many different structures and mechanisms. They form a structural

   that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the
   past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from
   the enemy [the ruling class] if he wins. And the enemy has not ceased to
   be victorious'. The British Marxist historians - such as Rodney Hilton,
   Christopher Hill, Victor Kiernan, George Rude, E.P. Thompson, Eric
   Hobsbawm - had that gift. Possessed with Marx's grand hypothesis that
   'The history of all hitherto existing societies has been the history of
   class struggle', and committed to recovering the past 'from the bottom
   up', especially the experiences, struggles and aspirations of the
   working classes, the British Marxist historians refashioned the history
   of the making of the modern world in a critical and democratic manner.
   This essay reviews their collective contributions to historiography and
   political thought, and considers their intellectual legacy in view of
   the historical and political challenges of the Twenty-first century. The
   author recognizes that we will have to ask new questions of past and
   present and develop new means of connecting our labours to popular
   historical memory, consciousness and imagination; but he argues that -
   if we, too, are to 'fan the spark of hope in the past' contra those who
   would declare the end of history - we would do well to appreciate the
   gifts of the British Marxist historians.

AB The paper focuses descriptively and analytically on the
   historiographical works of Alexander Hirner. The emphasis is on his
   works from the history of sociology in Slovakia. The paper divides the
   historiographical work of Alexander Hirner into three chronological
   chapters and one analytical chapter. The first chapter deals with
   Hirner's work in the 40s and, particularly, with his concept of the
   autonomy of Slovak history that was inspired by philosophy of vitalism.
   The second chapter aims at the description and the analytical evaluation
   of that period contest with the official Marxist historiography, that
   Hirner leaded in the 50s. Hirner did not agree with the Marxist
   simplifying concept of history that reduced the history to the
   monolinear change of social-economic formations. In contrary, Hirner
   advocated a more complex and less ideological study of the history. The
   third chapter mainly analyses Himer's crucial work from the domain of
   the sociological history - the monograph "Czechoslovak Sociology till
   the 1948", In this work, Hirner elaborated an original theoretical model
   for the historiographical study of sociology that can be universally
   applied as the basic framework for the analysis of the history of
   sociology. The last chapter of the paper analyses Hirner's concept of
   the meaning of the history. It suggests that Hirner perceived the
   meaning and progress of history, first of all, in the gradual national
   emancipation that should be interrelated with humanism, freedom and
   democracy. In the history of sociology, he considers a continually
   increasing unity of theory and empirical research to be the essential
   indicator of its scientific progress.

AB The Lukacs Circle in Szeged, a spontaneous, unofficial organization of
   young Hungarian scholars and philosophy teachers, characteristically
   represented Georg Lukacs' influence on young Hungarian intelligentsia in
   the period of late socialism. In this paper, the author recalls and
   critically analyses the intellectual milieu and motives that led a
   considerable part of young Hungarian intelligentsia of that time to make
   a cult of Lukacs' philosophy. The key to the analysis is the ambiguous
   character of the political feelings and philosophical orientation of
   many young people in the period of late socialism and the paradoxical
   `non-bourgeois bourgeois' character of Lukacs' philosophy. Lukacs' young
   followers were dissatisfied with the political conditions of 'real
   socialism' and with official Marxism. However, they considered
   themselves Marxists and were convinced by the anti-capitalist, romantic
   idea of democratic socialism. In the eyes of his young followers, Lukacs
   was a genuine philosopher whose teaching was interwoven by his
   wide-ranging bourgeois middle-class education, promising both a real
   philosophical alternative to official Marxism and a high-level
   philosophical foundation for a non-capitalist but democratic future
   human history. The author argues that Lukacs' philosophy did not satisfy
   these expectations. In his political philosophy, the philosopher could
   not move away from the mythological idea concerning the leading role of
   the communist party and therefore could not elaborate a genuine
   philosophical foundation for the idea of democratic socialism. Despite
   the superiority of his philosophy, his methodology and approach to the
   history of philosophy failed to provide a real philosophical alternative
   to the Bolshevik tradition of Marxism.

AB First I briefly review the emergence and development of business ethics,
   following three stages (1978-1984; 1984-1994; 1994 to the present) and
   driven by four factors: the inheritance of Chinese traditional ethics;
   the influence of Marxist philosophy and ethics; the reflections on the
   economic reform; and the influence of business ethics from abroad. Then,
   from a practical and a theoretical perspective, I discuss the main
   challenges for business ethics in China: issues of the economic system,
   of corporate ethics, and of management. After commenting on the role of
   business ethics for the social development in China, I offer some
   reflections about what China can contribute to, and learn from, other
   peoples.

AB Analytical Marxism involves the attempt to reconstruct Marxist theory
   and to refocus Marxist politics in the light of contemporary
   intellectual developments especially in analytical philosophy and
   economic theory-and historical events above all, the failures of
   Communist regimes. In order to assess this reconstruction it is
   necessary to bear in mind a conception of the overall Marxist project.
   By this standard of comparison it remains to be seen whether Analytical
   Marxism can effect the required kind of connection between its theory
   and its practice.

AB This discussion piece sets out to introduce Hegelian-Marxist dialectic,
   revolving around the wider concept of pr axis, to the wider
   meta-theoretical debate in International Relations. A perusal of the
   peculiar historical trajectory of IR theory, culminating in the
   ambiguities of the current 'post-positivist' debate, establishes the
   case for the necessity of explicating the meta-theoretical foundations
   upon which scientific statements are predicated, in ol der to allow for
   meaningful inter-paradigm debate and critique to take place. An excursus
   into the philosophy of science exemplifies the potency, if not
   superiority of dialectical thinking over and against various forms of
   traditional science, which were gradually forced to modify their
   positions by drawing on dialectical insights. Against this background,
   the article then observes the almost complete lack of dialectical theory
   in the discipline of IR, before it constructively attempts to
   systematise the core tenets of dialectical thinking. It is argued that
   G.W.F. Hegel's difficult formal categorical apparatus was given the
   adequate social content by Karl Marx allowing for a critical and
   comprehensive grasp of social and international relations.

   immersed in a major political transformation, the most significant such
   change since the Second World War, arising out of the rejection of
   official Marxism. This unforeseen rejection requires meditation by all
   those concerned with the relation of philosophy to the historical
   context. Marxism, that follows Marx's insistence on the link between a
   theory and the context in which it arises, cannot be indifferent to the
   rejection of Marxist theory in practice. In respect to the usual
   tendency to pass rapidly over practice for a theoretical analysis of
   social theory, Merleau-Ponty stands out for his concern to evaluate the
   theoretical claims of Marx and Marxism against practice.

AB This paper explores issues concerning the empowerment of students of
   management. In so doing, analogies are drawn between empowerment in
   particular educational and managerial contexts. There is a focus on the
   relationship between the educational implications of empowering students
   and the post-educational experiences of interacting within, more often
   than not, hierarchical organizations. The author acknowledges the
   contradictions he feels exist and the disquiet these contradictions lead
   to in his purporting to practise student empowerment in what he
   personally experiences as a disempowering world. Consequently he employs
   the writing of a wide range of authors to deconstruct his own
   experiences as a lecturer in a school of management. Reference is made
   to personal experience, and underlying issues are explored through the
   thoughts of writers from the following traditions: neo-Lukacsian,
   determinist-Marxist existential, radical and postmodern. The aim is not
   to provide prescriptive answers but to adopt a philosophical approach in
   the sense of philosophy as a 'battle against the bewitchment of our
   intelligence by means of language' (Cooper, 1990: 21). The suggestion is
   that educationalists have too readily 'talked into existence' the
   concept of empowerment without sufficient investigation into the nature
   of empowerment as an empirical reality.

AB W. Edwards Deming's philosophy of total quality management (TQM)
   constitutes more than an approach to management. It is also a
   full-fledged theory of organization and a theory of society and politics
   that holds important implications for relations between nation-states in
   the emerging ''new world order.'' When examined in this light, it
   appears that TQM is not collectivist or Marxist in the way that it is
   sometimes understood, but that it does stand in tension with a number of
   aspects of the traditional liberal American political and social
   tradition At the same time, however, it is quite consistent with the
   revolutionary, antifederalist subtheme that has persisted throughout
   U.S. history.

   The political consequences of this philosophical system are explored,
   leading to the conclusion that Lyotard's commitment to difference leads
   to political indifference. The philosophical roots of this indifference
   are detailed in Lyotard's Cartesian starting point and his analysis of
   Holocaust revisionism. This analysis reveals an idealist basis to
   Lyotard's philosophy of difference. Lyotard's concept of difference is

DI 10.1017/S0376892900010195
PD SUM 1995

AB A key characteristic of conservation in the United States is the
   dichotomy between two main philosophies. One of these is anthropocentric
   and utilitarian, advocating the wise use of Nature and natural
   resources, while the other is basically ecocentric, as it espouses
   principles of non-use and preservation. This dualism has existed since
   the early days of the conservation movement, when the formerly
   uncontrolled use of a supposedly limitless natural environment finally
   gave way to a policy of resource management which was designed to
   conserve Nature and resource availability within the framework of human
   utilization. Generally opposed to this historically dominant paradigm
   were those who believed in preserving Nature for its own sake, and who
   have laboured over the years to modify and ameliorate the prevalent,
   central pattern.
   After a period of relative unconcern, conservation underwent a
   resurgence as part of the environmental movement of the 1960s and 1970s.
   Environmental quality was the key concern, being highlighted by problems
   of pollution and degradation of the natural habitat. While providing the
   impetus for some broad environmental and conservation measures, this
   central focus directed primary attention to setting the problems. The
   traditional dominance of utilitarian resource management was maintained,
   relying on our managerial and scientific skills to address heightened
   environmental concerns. The era also spawned a number of other
   philosophies and themes. These have included a renewed sense of the
   ethics and spirituality of Nature, the emergence of ecology as a
   publicly-recognized-as-important field of science, 'greener' ecocentric
   movements, theories advocating more radical change, neo-Marxist theory
   on the relationship between Man and Nature, and various themes on
   limiting environmental growth and stress especially imposed by
   ever-increasing human numbers.
   Sustainable utilization ('development') represents the dominant paradigm
   at present. It advocates an anthropocentric but ecologically
   conservative philosophy towards Nature and the use of natural resources.
   The central bias attempts to balance conservation concerns with the need
   for economic development. This is a difficult task, given the typical
   priority of economic considerations. Other conservation themes,
   particularly those which address human values and needs, have had some
   positive effect, while the impact of ecology has been significant. These
   influences will hopefully increase to provide a better balance, and a
   brighter future, in the relationship between humans and their
   environment.

AB While for Marxist-Leninists Marxian theory implies the concept of a
   Centrally-Planned Economy (CPE) some western scholars hold that it would
   be incorrect and injust to consider Marx as the theoretical predecessor
   of a Soviet-type CPE. In contrast to these diverging views the article
   stresses the necessity of a more differentiated approach to the
   implications of Marxian analysis. On the one hand it is shown that
   inspite of many ambiguities it would be doubtful to derive from the
   economic analysis of Marx the concept of a CPE in a clear-cut way. On
   the other hand Marxian economics are connected to his Historical
   Materialism that has its origins in the philosophy of Hegel. It is shown
   that this philosophical background of Marx is the reason of most
   difficulties of understanding concerning Marx ideas of the breakdown of
   capitalism and of the structures of a post-capitalist economic system.
   It is shown that it is not in Marxian economics but in Marxian
   philosophy of Hegelian origin that CPE implications can be found.

   interest in Marxist philosophy. The magnitudes of philosophical
   literature on Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Hegel recorded in annual volumes
   of The Philosopher's Index have all been shrinking in recent years. In
   the 1992 volume, the share of the publications on Marx within all
   philosophical publications has dropped to almost one-third of what it
   was on average in the 1981-1985 volumes, on Engels and Lenin to about
   one-fifth, and on Hegel to about two-thirds.

AB The nucleus of postmodern philosophy and theory is derived primarily
   from French neostructuralist writings. The ontological foundation of
   such literature is the idealist rejection of the possibility of knowing
   reality and, as a consequence, the enclosure of the subject within the
   signifying universe, which in turn results in the exaltation of the
   signifying processes as the only social processes. The same emphasis,
   but through nonverbal means, is demonstrated by postmodern architectural
   and urban design. In geography, however, postmodernism is interpreted
   differently. In two recent books (by Soja and by Harvey) the postmodern
   era in human geography is related to the heightened importance of space
   for social reality and theory. But the split of geography itself between
   Marxist geography on the one hand, and behavioural and humanistic
   geography on the other, shows the pertinence of the signifying dimension
   for the field of geography. In this paper, it is argued that the roles
   of space and meaning are equally important for geography, and it is
   proposed that an analysis of the signifying aspect of space may be
   achieved through semiotics, currently the most complete and
   sophisticated theory of meaning and culture. The main problem for
   geography, which is addressed in the final section of this paper, is the
   integration of a renewed version of the semiotics of space with an
   equally renewed Marxist geography, the most powerful explanatory
   approach to geography we have at our disposal.

AB This article considers the significance of the fall of communism for the
   question of the truth of Marxism. It begins by considering some Marxist
   theories of Stalinism and some Marxist criticisms of Bolshevism. Having
   rejected the adequacy of those theories, the author goes on to argue
   that while Stalinism in part rests on a nonmarket vision of socialism
   derived from Marx, contrary to an argument of Carl Cohen, this vision is
   not deeply rooted in Marxist philosophy.

AB With the dismantling of Marxist-Leninist ideology, fresh inspiration has
   been discernible in recent Soviet philosophy. This article argues that a
   major area of concern is the nature of the human being a theme formerly
   dominated by the ''social'' conceptions inscribed into official
   historical materialism. Soviet philosophers are examining such
   categories as culture, spirit, consciousness, and personality with an
   eye to their common characteristics. For many, the latter is grounded in
   the nature of the person, the specificity of which lies in a morally
   qualified unity of action, sentiment, and reason. The author brings
   together evidence for this thesis and discusses the arguments of the
   Soviet philosophers with an eye to their conceptual resources and
   models.

   (1) to acknowledge the influence of sociobiology in a wide number of
   disciplines and areas of inquiry; (2) to illustrate the ways in which
   practitioners of these disparate disciplines employ sociobiological
   approaches in their own fields or study; and (3) to introduce major
   principles of sociobiology.
   Contributors assess the current and potential influence of sociobiology
   in their own fields, including psychiatry (Randolph M. Nesse), law (John
   H. Beckstrom), management theory (J. Gary Bernhard and Kalman Glantz),
   anthropology (William Irons), economics (Robert H. Frank), primatology
   (Birute Galdikas and Paul Vasey), history (Laura Betzig), political

AB The diversity of thought among American economists is investigated using
   samples of the memberships of the American Economic Association, the
   Union for Radical Political Economists and the Association for
   Evolutionary Economics. Discriminant analysis reveals a complex web of
   theoretical and organizational integration and separatism involving
   theoretical orientation in economics, emulative economists, scholarly
   research focus, organizational membership, and political values. The
   modal radical economist espouses a radical political economic philosophy
   and pursues Marxist/radical scholarship in an academic setting. The
   modal neoclassical economist, radical in neither disciplinary nor
   personal political beliefs, is found, more often than the other types,
   in nonacademic administrative work. Marxist/radical and institutionalist
   scholarship are mutually exclusive. Other dimensions of the professional
   role, as well as a number of social and biographical background
   characteristics, do not differentiate between types of economists.

AB Svatopluk Stur (1901-1981) was one of the leading philosophers of
   democratic orientation in Slovakia. He was a professor at the Bratislava
   university and he was active mainly in the period between the world wars
   and in 1945-1948. He is an offspring of a famous Slovak revivalist
   family. He considered his philosophy to be a peculiar form of critical
   realism and a part of the modern liberal philosophical movement. He
   adopted creatively the humanistic thoughts of T. G. Masaryk, B. Croce,
   J. L. Fischer and other European thinkers and he developed them in the
   special situation of Slovakia. He was discriminated by both the
   totalitarian regime of the years 1939-1944 and the communist regime
   after 1948, when he was not allowed to teach at the university. One of
   the important Stur's works is his Treatise on Life, written during the
   Nazi occupation and published in 1946 in Bratislava. The chapters of the
   book deal with a philosophy of life; with art - as its specific form and
   part; with science - as the theoretical order of the world; with ethics
   - as the practical order of the social life.  The present study, written
   by Slovak philosopher J. Uher, throws light on the meaning of the Stur's
   work mentioned in the context of contemporary philosophy and evaluates
   it. Besides the Treatise on Life Svatopluk Stur wrote and published in
   Slovakia the following works: The Problem of the Transcendent in
   Contemporary Philosophy, 1938; The Meaning of the Slovak Revival, 1948;
   The German Will to Power, 1944-1967 - as a Nazi paraphrase of
   Nietzsche's Will to Power. His Marxist-Leninist Will to Power appeared
   only posthumously (1991) and there are other still unpublished
   manuscripts left in his heritage.

AB The situation in Soviet philosophy has changed radically in the course
   of the last 4 years. Gone is the attitude according to which
   philosophers fall into two camps; genuine developments are discernible
   in the direction of alternative thinking. Signs of the latter include
   the growing number of round-table discussions published in the main
   philosophical journals, the conversations among philosophers broadcast
   on television, the new textbook, with its stress on the history of
   philosophy, including a new look at the 'classics', especially Marx. In
   general, Marxist-Leninist doctrine is now relativized to the status of a
   moment in the history of philosophy, and is no longer regarded as the
   culmination of philosophical truth.
   The main questions occupying philosophers today cluster around the
   nature of the person: individual freedom, democracy, universal values,
   as well as the central importance of law in civil society and a legally
   sanctioned State. The revival of interest in Russian religious
   philosophy has to be approached with care as it involves several
   dimensions: the question of Russia's spiritual character as compared
   with the West, the confrontation with the heretofore reigning
   materialist view of the world in relation to the vexed question of human
   creativity, as well as the religious affirmation of the unity of
   humanity in opposition to the Marxist conception of difference and
   struggle. The situation in Soviet philosophy is still ambiguous so long
   as ideological attitudes persist which could hinder the development of
   autonomous philosophical thought.

AB In the former socialist countries the relation of philosophy to social
   reality, as shaped by the political interests of the State, must be
   considered for each particular case with a view to the historical
   dynamics of its own development. The Polish case is not typical in this
   regard - it was determined by the failure of forced sovietization at the
   institutional, cultural level and the maintenance of Poland's
   traditional contacts with Western European culture. In this regard
   Polish universities played an important role since they preserved
   'normal' structures of academic activity.
   Philosophy in Poland has been marked by three currents which managed to
   rebuff the advances of Marxism. Best known among them is the Lwow-Warsaw
   school of logic and analytic philosophy. Its contribution is especially
   important in the methodology of philosophical inquiry and the style of
   responsible philosophical discourse. Though not a bed of political
   opposition the school's members mounted a 'spiritual opposition' to
   Marxism, especially during the Solidarity period. Catholic philosophy,
   as represented by the Catholic University of Lublin (KUL), has been and
   remains a completely independent force in Eastern and Central Europe.
   Doctrinally, Catholic philosophy in Poland has been divided between a
   more traditional, dated Thomism and the more progressive circles in
   Cracow where Western European philosophy, especially phenomenology,
   existentialism, and hermeneutics, has been influential (the significance
   of Jozef Tischner and Karol Wojtyla, now Pope Jean Paul II). The third
   major current, centered in Cracow, is the phenomenology of Roman
   Ingarden, whose influence is manifest in a style of philosophizing that
   has attracted professional philosophers as well as committed
   intellectuals from different disciplines.
   Against this diversified background Marxism had to prove its mettle, a
   requirement that explains the unique internal differentiation and
   pluralism within Polish Marxist philosophy. The decisive factors in its
   development were its rejection of Soviet Marxism-Leninism and the
   opening to Western Marxism. The often remarked 'revisionist' character
   of Polish Marxism consists in the recognition by its most talented
   representatives of the fundamental incompatibility between Marxism as
   the ideological legitimation of the Communist state and as a philosophy
   subject to rational criteria. In effect, Polish Marxists thought the
   theory through to its end, and in this sense brought to light its
   inherently unstable nature: to be a philosophy it would have to cease to
   be Marxist, to be Marxist means having to pander to ideology.
   The confrontation of the diverse currents in Polish philosophy
   contributed to an unfortunate result: for political reasons non-Marxists
   steered clear of social philosophical questions, while official Marxism,
   which suppressed the 'revisionist' trend, obfuscated the relation
   between philosophy and social reality. Today philosophy in Poland has
   the urgent task to contribute to the reconstruction of a social
   rationality combining a critical consciousness with moral elements of
   commitment and responsibility.

AB What is the fate of philosophy as the spiritual weapon of the
   proletariat in changing reality when it is clear that the communist
   experiment has failed? The question pertains above all to the heritage
   of Marx's theory, not to Marxism and Marxism-Leninism. The latter are
   party-inspired and -dominated and aspire to be schools of philosophy,
   whereas Marx did not seek to create a philosophy but to realize
   philosophy in the material world. For Marx, philosophy and emancipation
   go hand in hand: man is emancipated when philosophy is realized in the
   world.
   The fate of the Marxian idea is set off against the development of
   dialectical materialist philosophy and Marxist social theory. In this
   way, the ground is laid for the conclusion that what is properly
   philosophical in Marx is restricted to a philosophy of history attendant
   on a theory of economic development The conclusion is subject to the
   caveat that as yet unpublished notes by Marx about the true nature of
   dialectic may in fact reveal a more far-reaching philosophical
   conception.
   The realization of philosophy seems like a romantic illusion against the
   background of the events in Germany in autumn 1989. The working masses
   have elected capital as the basis of their future social existence, thus
   putting paid to the Marxian theme of class struggle. The fundamental
   conclusion is that Marx's vision of the task of philosophy is vitiated
   by a deep-rooted ambivalence: on one hand it is the 'head' of
   emancipation but on the other hand it neglects, indeed suppresses,
   historical details, as shown by the example of the dialectic of class
   struggle and class exchange. This kind of suppression, neglect, comes to
   the fore in Marx's writing whenever he substitutes his romantic vision
   of the deprived proletariat for social science. This blind eye to detail
   is at the root of the later ideologization of Marxist theory and its
   subordination to local party interests.

AB Classical Soviet Marxism-Leninism is in the process of dissolution, with
   some parts of the ideology being rejected, others retained in one form
   or another, and new components being adopted. At the same time, a
   wide-ranging pluralism of new objectives and forms of consciousness has
   emerged in Soviet intellectual life. Since both the motives for
   restructuring and also the braking effects acting on the process of
   perestrojka are significantly dependent upon intellectual and
   ideological developments, attentive observations of these developments
   is of particular importance for the assessment of the evolutionary
   prospects of the Soviet Union. At present the situation on the
   ideological-intellectual front can be characterized as follows: 1.
   Although official changes in the ideology did not begin until 1989 they
   have caught up to the initial perestrojka in political and cultural
   life. 2. Perestrojka has continually waned in importance as an
   ideological by-word largely under the influence of Gorbachv's 'new
   thinking' which has turned attention to the dramatic history of the
   Soviet Union and the plight of the human individual in a society with
   few prospects for the future. 3. In philosophy the new textbook
   published in 1989/90 introduces a series of crucial innovations that put
   paid to a number of classical shibboleths of the Marxist-Leninist world
   view. 4. Academic philosophy has shifted more and more to a
   reexamination of the history of philosophy as well as to a reappraisal
   of pre-revolutionary Russian thought. 5. The critique of Stalinism has
   gradually given way to a critique of Marxist principles generally, and
   even Lenin has become the subject of criticism. 6. Fast on the heels of
   the new thinking and the ideological deconstruction come the voices of
   political orientations whose differences are so pronounced as to have
   warranted the compilation of an 'Atlas of ideologies'. 7. The search for
   a new moral identity has concentrated on three sources: the
   reestablishment of links with classical Russian culture, the renewal of
   links with Europe, and the deep-seated need to commit oneself to some
   ideal for sacrifice. 8. The economic crisis has produced attitudes
   hostile to individual gain and speculation. 9. Given the nature of the
   Soviet crisis intellectual cooperation with the West has to take forms
   which promote the rekindling of a sense of all-human awareness of the
   transcendent and reinforce the experience of common humanity. 10. The
   establishment of all-European academic institutions designed in their
   very structure to engage in mutual cooperation could have a catalytic
   effect on the reconfiguration of Europe.

AB The Parsonian and post-Parsonian action frame of reference was, among
   other things, an attempt to unify a fragmented tradition, and its later
   critics have measured its performance against this claim The critique
   which paves the way for the Parsonian project is mainly directed against
   an inadequate conception of rational action; the constructive part of
   the argument centers on the normative structure of social action. The
   result is a very selective synthesis of the traditional sources In
   particular, the predominant interest in the rational and normative
   dimensions of action leads Parsons to neglect earlier insights into its
   creative and transformative capacities. The latter aspects were among
   the main themes of the philosophy of praxis. But although the Parsonian
   model of action has come under extensive criticism from various angles
   the concept of praxis has not played an important role in this context.
   Even those who explicitly link their critique of Parsons to the Marxian
   notion of praxis, e.g. Giddens, seem less interested in its later
   career. Conversely, one of the major weakness of the philosophy of
   praxis was its failure to draw the appropriate lessons from the
   sociological critique of Marx, and to bring them to bear on the
   basis-superstructure model, which it tended to bypass rather than
   destroy. There was no attempt in the philosophy of praxis to combine the
   move beyond the paradigm of production with Weber's and Durkheim's
   arguments against economic reductionism, or - to put the same point
   another way - with their insights into the radical autonomy and
   constitutive role of culture and politics. Once again, the
   interconnected problematics of culture and power appear as a testing
   ground for alternative theories of action. They have been selected on
   both sides of the debate. Neo-Marxist and post-Marxist concepts of
   praxis are clearly deficient in this regard, but the Parsonian synthesis
   can also be questioned more effectively if rational and normative
   structures are regarded as ways of coordinating the patterns of culture
   and power.
